You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell somewhere in place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, at the middle school, to Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When they were left to bleeding every week in the bathroom and the kids -- until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the head of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1950s, I felt the need to begin to work in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults never get to know us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring to that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to do this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized she needed to be <unk>
We found one place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
We knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted <unk> as adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made up in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly be <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I salute my around <unk> of the water about 60 feet -- and I couldn't better think that it was a snowflake on another snowflake, year after year.
<unk> are born when they go out of the glaciers or break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others cannot be more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and by themselves, largely as we see ourselves as a human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts a iceberg releases fresh freshwater that feeds many forms of life.
I come close to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portrait of my ancestry, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they won't exist in that way.
It's not the death of death when they're <unk> it's not a end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to be able to see a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> <unk> iceberg in size.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too excited about the details of conception, because if they stop to think about understanding -- I don't get to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case -- the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome joins the X X <unk>
Both of the <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to you later.
In my activity that is performing two roles.
In one of my roles with the story of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people started to start the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how the body fluids have considered the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance is in my job is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex and individuals whose physics would not fit in the <unk> male and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have an sex that doesn't fall into the male and male forms or <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene.
And then, in life, the testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, your body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high <unk> levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops in the course of a <unk> course of <unk>
When you <unk> the baby is like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something that's going on.
After taking tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think that this is a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his structure, <unk> I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> who was born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life like a kid and I had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitalia were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component -- typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors figured out that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is that they have broken tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know well why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are to be <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> it's not to be able to have better physical health health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that you get in a number of surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman who is a woman who is having a <unk> identity wants to say to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children born like two people inside one body.
The most peak is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put into trial in trial his sex at <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What would you test to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't penetrate a <unk> line between men and women or between men or <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it goes to science, we need to admit that these <unk> categories were to admit that these <unk> categories were kind of a stable <unk> categories that are perceived directly with <unk> <unk> <unk> they are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a really rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably very <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put in a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still not <unk>
If he stopped moving it down.
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a prisoner's dilemma to really determine death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
And I would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought to me.
<unk> from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find myself every time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The fathers <unk> was for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I tell you why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents are, <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were out of the idea that it was going to be the political power of the blood of the <unk> the father and then the son, and so on.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part of it they were doing it because they get part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of the fathers -- <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of the explanations -- and so they <unk> the concept of being able to spread it from a vague idea of birth right from birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the bases of the future movement of <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women are <unk>
Then he came the success of Civil Rights movement with people of the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that we get to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should teach anatomy.
I don't want to say that five year-old children were supposed to be allowed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, by the contrary, was born in term: was born over March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed all the rights three months before Henry -- the right for the right to Henry <unk> right, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because I have a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the French <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on the way, doesn't have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So still <unk> <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went into the field of the anatomy that we get to the point to have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are caught in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided to get married with a man you don't have to have chromosome and to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests <unk> people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you about the beginning of Capgras syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I want <unk> to <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to do this for <unk> rights to people, because I will admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know you can make more <unk> <unk> <unk> about their sex relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an <unk>
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to <unk> unless it's willing to be <unk> to a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that had made birth <unk> and then pick up their <unk>
But when the phone, I asked her to the <unk> operation -- a very <unk> operation -- they responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of the separation <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how the democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we would have gotten more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered a feminist, like <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question of the question, more than there is something that is female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people over the state, it is possible that that we might have been more <unk> to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when you bring democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a bigger life, think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to live and work, have the chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily remove the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments they were either owners and that the other half is still not <unk> to do it.
Could you try to increase the capacity for <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and build a whole new apartment building a whole new apartments always and when the rules of that place will be able to get the building <unk>
So I proposed that governments will have new market zones to contain cities, big enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name, <unk> cities.
I found later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next election <unk> <unk> <unk> became a platform in which <unk> <unk> and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and pick all the current residents of apartments.
They have a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of the technologies as a <unk> rules for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk.
He showed you to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable people are cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going on, and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country will move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covering over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was <unk> at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could go to what could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And they also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries to help them establish and make the <unk> norms that they could all be able to trust the <unk> so that they could actually be <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to take a few thousand square kilometers.
And shortly afterwards, 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional treatment that would allow these special special regions.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis, voting in the Congress for this constitutional component was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, it passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> is to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center of the city that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to make the <unk> and then allow the <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing her to allow his Supreme Court to be the final court of this new justice system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go into the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a job work, sometimes they're unwed mothers, who have to win the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents that have not seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends asked me to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find clothes, and more recently, photograph and I would post in my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and the second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people who are usually going to do my money is going to be a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what it was in this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for a week is everything I put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me about the woman who walks for TED in clothes --  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that we would have to, or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see a phenomenal thing for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in a week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not only will you tell you, you also get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're sitting in.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost safe that you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, you don't find that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week, just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to get into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I was going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> colorful and bright suit, if there's a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you put on a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these ends, but I think that for most members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both of them <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, like most of the other quantum physical physical physicists -- we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A little intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be only at one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a little boy playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that <unk> bar taught a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a big model that you can have the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physics, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like you can go through walls, or that they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanical theory.
At that point there was the physics -- some years -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my own logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of mechanical mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It finds right in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of a metal, a kind of springboard a springboard and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip with a new silicon chip for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people will go up to do those things, because I don't want them to hear them, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues on inanimate objects are not only people -- it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave in the quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled out all the air and pulled it up to a temperature of less than a degree for the absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free of acting as it.
So we measured your motions.
We discovered that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> and the way he <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's only at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
This was a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can only be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, this is my logical <unk>
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How did your consciousness do if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we looked at it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
That's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, which is here and he allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were going to do it with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story explains simply on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art art.
And so when I started traveling and go to museums, began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, let's start to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite -- the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click on, and we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move out there and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jump into it.
They're inside that you want to go to the end of the hall,
You keep going. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went in, and I discovered that the children were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole of <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get down even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come to come, one second.
So now we're going quickly to jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite one, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very easy, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main things is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even comes from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice in your work and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that they ask me today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a <unk> a flying pixel in it.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in <unk> careers and one in the last two decades.
And some time, if you wanted to win a <unk> career, one, I would take a budget, and you would take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good, you made the career.
This is what we are, in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems of control in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered by networks and electronics.
They're going to become open computers.
And, as <unk> they're starting to respond differently, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I note aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like all of the existing atoms become <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you know, you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> non <unk> And so what don't you say?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before play.
The line of time is on the top.
At the early afternoon, there are people here and there doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a fast call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone was at the center of the winner of the winner and the first minister of then.
And then everybody left.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and use.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some little tags to track the garbage in its shift for the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all in <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results of <unk>
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't forget that it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we dropped a day still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about, at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, you will show patterns, images, text.
And by <unk> the curtain is opening up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it very much.
And we had a commission to design the input to the entry of the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows -- but when you come up with so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it's low almost all of the architecture goes down.
Here it is working.
You see people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to not try and test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open up to let it happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in the water and one had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes in color as a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw earlier, that moves with others in <unk>
Could we form this cloud,
And a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, and different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, to the one that you can close to and <unk> and see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of discussions today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D motions and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the catch in different <unk>
It's both 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them take a little bit of a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've got everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power of the networks of the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it's going to be able to share the main moments of the Olympics of the Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So, it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, you could improve it by a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in a better way, to be more strong, having more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and safer for ourselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who would always want to be more creative.
What else would you get?
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people would choose creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> I probably owe to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this, the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference and I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the <unk> Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology -- it's a sense for the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or <unk>
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is of course, the most interested in it.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> where it comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the intestine more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> makes it the <unk> think of <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully inclusive environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, slum is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort from it.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some <unk> going into the way.
But by others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients -- and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of <unk>
But when the <unk> organisms, things start to change.
It goes into a scene of sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens to the entire genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but every year I was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night he hits her door at a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a magnificent <unk> of clothes.
He looks at it and says, <unk> in search for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, he says, George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of going through the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us would have the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to say, <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily support longevity.
They don't necessarily deserve the largest or stronger or faster and even the smartest of the most.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive to the heat of the <unk> that we would argue, if there were fish there, we would have fish there, and yet, they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look back thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to engage ourselves as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, you know, <unk> <unk> and we got so excited that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for us to happen.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of the natural kind of natural type, spread through the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we kind of <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce the evolution of nature.
But there's a third possibility, a possibility -- intriguing and scary possibility.
And I call it the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and familiar.
Think of it also that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes for eliminating diabetes or Alzheimer's or to reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
There is not a lot of a lot to be able to actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more and more to the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren't only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine -- in a <unk> plant cells.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg -- and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, to remove diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want to be more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> <unk> <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that lets us run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be able to say.
And when we are in conditions to pass this up to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could be 100 thousand years away, and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful society, more <unk>
Or are we going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust, and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flight assistants <unk>
So he immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem, probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already cracked the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
That's not the road.
It was <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I died, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the things I wanted to get in, and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to read, all the experiences I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about it later on, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while I took the bridge, George Washington, which was not a lot of -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity.
But in my humanity I also took place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be breaking on 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I did, I had the feeling of, <unk> dying isn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love it. I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in one thought, which is just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be like it, but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you going to do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many different projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
And one day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation design so that, obviously, graffiti is a <unk> thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and having a pretty good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they're making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
And I sat down with his brother and his father there at that very moment, all right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make the art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has both inside your interior can't be able to <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research who has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser loan, you draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around by making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First, they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a whole year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of a way we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of safe companies, and we got a machine so that we could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't get it? This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> you would have taken the frames of the walls and in his place, there would be <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of hot sunglasses that we bought in the shipping ride of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and you build yourself, we published the code <unk> the software goes down into free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no business company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that I can say, "No."
Anyone with paralysis today have access to drawing and communicate with just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much about you.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning two weeks of programming sessions in the entire night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed and I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking number of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what we would say, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and get me to get me out of it so that I could get a <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, we've developing.
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix them and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 invention of 2010, and it was really great.
And the best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close to the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> center in the Los Angeles center is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> in urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the computer -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, you know, if it's not now, you know? And if I am not a person.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in situations and at the same time a lot of dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> areas.
And I spent 30 days by eating this fun of the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been involved in situations in situations where horrible with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that we will <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that look <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was going to come up here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk <unk>
What I had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content that I could do in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But I said this is a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy your name.
If you would have asked me a year ago that I would have been able to do with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could get rid of anything that could be so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that treating the <unk> of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest <unk> ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom of the end, he has some <unk> images all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title, the brand, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we were going to take all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you put a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most great car you've driven in "The largest <unk> ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is so far from showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> which is <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The whole shot of the film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the complete idea -- all the film was beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive people are going to be.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does we need to do this?
MS: One and a half million and a half -- <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to get the meeting with them, but that certainly is worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film comes out to us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or being me?
JK: So two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of it wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, to make so much of them as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> of the <unk> is not the idea of telling that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error -- and that error was this.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no error at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what it represents this image.
See, when you look for images of Google <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to actually something changed again.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started to talk to the companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want to build a story, but we would have <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he looked at myself as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in the story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there is <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away from my mind and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out is suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking about companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, big, giant movies, others who make small films -- independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who do Hollywood Hollywood movies, they say the reason that their movies have so successful is because of the players associated with those marks that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, <unk> movie <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have a man as well for man to make a solid, <unk> <unk>
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, to remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep them cool more time? With more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are telling the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: Okay, so what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
They usually carry off as a sun sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the same.
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of hippie in part of it -- <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
We have toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that that?
<unk> I am a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I often sat down at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photographs, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photo.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of it.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world? And I think your world is the world that we are going to think about -- your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you live in.
All of those things come from. And they start in a place and in my case where you start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things. I like the weird things.
A: <unk> of the <unk> for what is for that?
What's the <unk> What a phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
It was a little bit about that.
<unk> more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the Morgan brand, <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to fall into one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually make them <unk> and you make them become positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are that?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and mathematics, those things that have gone and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your identity of brand, your personality of brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful is going to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> and magical <unk> like <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
Are you a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you stable, stable, familiar -- reliable <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI resonance to identify the desire centers in the brain both for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paulo where advertising in the air <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting up in the schools with the U.S. issues in the U.S.
So the amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the most answer or the ones I've had more successful is those in which I've been involved with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their donor agencies, and they said perhaps these agencies have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They got success?
Well, since the movie was sent in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was first of January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because most of the agencies that we talk about to their customers won't be a part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you take people out of that is pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees at the risk aversion is preparing their entire company to be <unk>
I feel that what is going to happen to progress is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, going on, I think we need to give it a place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than ever kind of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who would have bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data on great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So so, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization of TED, the <unk> Foundation to be applied to my assistance for TED from next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active weapons to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash cash virus, in a laptop computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> go into the gray box <unk> hurt the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear show is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part -- the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these gray, <unk> these <unk> systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what was happening with this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> became <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then of experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at actively in the gray box if you find a certain configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place:
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the heart code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex, and in high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 billion code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called function in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and try to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that this is definitely a violent <unk> must be a <unk> white one, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
You don't find a number of thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I was asked to do it in an effort for <unk> his experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
You rotor it is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And so it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been brought after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were able to call one single goal, but from different <unk>
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're really confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I was really surprised.
There's the gray, <unk> and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values for sensors for pressure sensors and the <unk> sensors and the vibration sensors -- which is still running during the attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds in <unk> video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not be <unk>
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes away from speed, you have to open from escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit it.
And I don't have the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
Could it work also, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great number of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to get a robot that is going to be able to <unk> or another one that makes them from the wheels of your wheels to get a little bit back and come back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that is put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is also increasing their speed, and help, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on their back a 45 kilos, and it's <unk> and he will get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage on the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that I could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds per land for a number of hours.
Their flexible, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running the movement with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs of <unk> about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, roughly, in <unk> chairs all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often -- very young people with damage in the spinal cord that when you start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
And we also talk about the population that are missing as much as <unk>
Her only option, many times -- for one brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who is that 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda are using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that they send signals on the board, here on the back.
There are some of the batteries that give power to the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this <unk> <unk>
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom -- it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> movement down.
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> I'll never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last little bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the bottom of <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs of <unk> to everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say, hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living kin.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is Bonobo in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still yet.
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of great <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been over for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder this destruction is also that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation are making you not get to fill a stadium with the Bonobos that they stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the game rules.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you watch the game Bonobo is looking at the roots very <unk> the same of the laughter, the dance and the human show.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken out of the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk football about.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> has <unk>
Just I think in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common both in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that, sometimes we play themselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the realization that Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a more difficult world and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's get to the most of our ability to <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and human <unk> life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the least appropriate to play, you can be the moments when it's the most urgent time.
So fellow primates, we'll accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain <unk> in a black fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers are in a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of it.
But still, there was a race standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the world's worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first to the captain and he asked him to fit and <unk> the dog of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that for the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a car building to save a live <unk> just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to do the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> firefighters that the more or less had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house <unk> for the house owner where, as you would expect, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the house owner for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as in my calling as voluntary internally I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> but also acts of grace and courage on the individual.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are all of the remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a park park.
They are mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you train the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first particular blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement cement from a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most <unk> building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He was called a brick of <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 blocks for each person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the particular block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a aesthetic brick world, piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits, a brick at time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was only to experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are all electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing is that they're linked through magnets together.
So you can't be able to be wrong in the wrong way.
The bricks have a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the <unk> the pink is the input and the orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly, you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with a green one, you produce light.
Can we put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
So we had this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or more slow to just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increased collection of it.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get <unk> to <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how a light works at night, or why is the door of an elevator you keep open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Here's an example of a project that has actually done, a <unk> dollar <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is to get involved with the focus on the focus on the focus on it.
It's about distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I've heard about time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk> for <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting them into the Third World we send it to the wild world.
They worked with the <unk> employees worked with <unk>
Your task is to show you the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> of the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what really searches is that someone else is stuck with the snow -- because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered with a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, I was doing a lot last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members named Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you were <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe the smallest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it stretches up viral.
One responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that would be able to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this is not happening.
The software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that I had done by the normal channels that would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that at the time has taken over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best of the best ways of working, not as in private companies, such as a lot of people think it should be.
Nor as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk> form.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of dealing with the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who serve with <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration of that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we're putting together, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they're not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I'd ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> don't have the government yes.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from us -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> The way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of the telephone and services center.
It's the place that serves calls if you make <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the official knowledge base.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open the doors of the house, put it very strong music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a phone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile website, called <unk> <unk>
They didn't give that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
And one day, this really gets this <unk> <unk> in my trash cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the spot, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of a platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to become and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
He connected to the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services of being necessary but our neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When your neighbor helps the other, they will raise their communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have we chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of a <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us with that that we financed as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and a consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make it sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And so what we've been faced with the government, is time we ask ourselves, what world we want to leave to our kids.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of <unk>
We can't deal with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can be expanding <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not that hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- <unk> I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your views in any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't care much about making your voices.
They're using their hands.
They get the work to program applications that do work better to government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, by taking out <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have <unk> those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not just consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't <unk> the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a swarm of voices, or we'll be able to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, in prisons, in the death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here are impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would have no other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard to be strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery to <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit of it, she would look at me and I would give me a good hug.
I was so hard that I barely could breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and I said, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I was going back to me again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that he had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get your time and your attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So he looked at him and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I got up in the room, and he grabbed my hand and said, "Come on. The two are going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know. I said, <unk>
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to tell you, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that the <unk>
As I went back to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want to tell you, is that you're always going to do the right thing even though it's going to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
And then finally, he said, "The third thing I want to tell you, is that he never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like this.
I grew up in the field, in South <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where <unk> took me to my sister and myself and went to the forest.
We only get the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, I'm going to say, but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And he looks at me with strength and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something in front of you.
I'll tell you something you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the other that they really don't see it.
We can't get them to do things that do not believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> I had 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, poor or black, finds so much <unk> so much wealth by these facts.
One of the three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in prison or freedom is in jail.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, <unk> 50 to 60 percent of all young people in prison are in prison or freedom of parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a criminal system that is much better about whether you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger are making us believe that these are not a deal of ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some good developments curious.
In my state, in Alabama, so in fact, as in other states, you would care about because you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before he was <unk> the law of the right vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where the age of 13 years later, to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance of getting out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They get people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've been fascinated by thinking that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not trying to decide whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people, <unk> has identified one that is innocent and liberated from death row.
An worth of mistake, <unk> an innocent <unk>
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not ever be able to fly airplanes if any of every nine that would be <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I'm talking about slavery to you.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the rebuilding of the World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a <unk> time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what he defined his lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say to me, <unk> Stevenson, you show talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history, for the first time with terror, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country, we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what historically, we've done.
All of the time <unk> one with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage you with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's well disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> We don't have death death in Germany.
We can never be able to be here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> we could be <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not make it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate the two things.
lately lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that wants to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are in spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
The development of the innovation, the development comes from not just brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from ideas -- also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at it not only in the bright and <unk> but also dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering -- we wanted to do all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no kind of disconnect related to technology and design, which lets us be truly humans if we don't pay attention to your attention to poverty, to <unk> to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege being a young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together to speak.
Occasionally, <unk> lady called me to say, <unk> comes the old lady -- we're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and get it.
I was like, "I know lady. Be lady.
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I would go and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, <unk> <unk> tell me that it's that idea of <unk> justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I began to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We tried to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and when I was looking at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> put me your finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, that problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, that's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very exhilarating, we don't judge ourselves by our technology, for our designs, or our own intellectual capacity.
By the end, they <unk> the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful people, but because of the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand real issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can you have a judge to turn someone in whatever it is?
The judge would be <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night, I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't you, you must have the magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer, a small, poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> to be treated as a <unk> white white white <unk>
In the <unk> I put that there had been developing conduct in <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to the cut.
It took about two months, I was already forgotten.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And I finally went down from the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black black man was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I was <unk> and <unk>
And I was standing in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> I said, "I am <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They got the policemen by the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how the room was full of people who were mad because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> who was going and <unk>
And I would look out the window, and I would invite you to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking around and so on.
Finally, this old black black <unk> walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed you <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran on the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black one stood up looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man who keeps his view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of us here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, from this community, to help in your purposes, doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which an effort is going to be able to make the funds that you spend today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that they <unk> these funds to make the law, at security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the U.S. in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the greatest rate of <unk>
What would you say to what you think is that?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it arises this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince ourselves for the rhetoric of it.
We have three legal causes for bringing people to <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, for small crime crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you get excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats of Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media media prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay them attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day our senses, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing we care more than to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning <unk> the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us the negative news to us about seven days of week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, is no wonder that we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress has done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the species of species, the scarcity of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita -- adjusted by inflation has been <unk> across the world.
The child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles Kenny that global literacy spent 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we keep <unk> higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the significance of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, toilets, television, mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century -- the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So it was a lot of this technology and together, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, what soft is -- at good and bad times, in the war and peace, in the recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the opening of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a number of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends from Autodesk call infinite computing and networks, 3D printing and their ability to democratize the personalized production and distribute personalized production, all the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think to create abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is short and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> in the 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk> <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington <unk> is from aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like the <unk>
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made of aluminum something so cheap that we use it as it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's not about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is the 50 percent less than the produced by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents a <unk> compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy as we have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after a <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of the water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent ice is ice, and we went through the <unk> of the water of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen, this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any extra source, <unk> water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just realized that I will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation that has this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better communication communications in the middle of Kenya that the Reagan president, 25 years ago.
And to tell a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever happened.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video libraries of <unk> images, libraries of books and music, technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing is going to come up with the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with the ones that talk to you, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> the blood of the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers, and there are <unk> health workers.
When this <unk> device would be a RNA virus or DNA that would not be able to call the health care and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the mark of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, going from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What would you do? What wishes to do?"
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and power to act for the first time?
What about these three billion?
And if they're contributions we cannot <unk>
Something that I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams guided by his passion with a clear goal, they can do things -- things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've been played with this university professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started to <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion for the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three new minds of new minds that we care about to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades of time.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> the <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that I was <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught it very much until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have special <unk>
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept:
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some mangroves.
There were <unk> from about 20 percent, the <unk> <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> at five inches.
They had a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
That's nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fisheries <unk>
And this boat, quite ugly, <unk> <unk>
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the Sea Ocean <unk> and, mostly in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of these tiny things about <unk> remains of coral reef.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing.
The bottom line is a solid coral background, in this case, being a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They didn't have the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
It was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect fishermen every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
You know, the starting point of start, at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you will, this happens something like this.
On the axis we have <unk> biodiversity, many killer whales, the country, the supply of water.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images to be welcomed to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a normal sea with big fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
With time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us are going to have like Captain and maybe I looked at a lot of fish in this area you can't be used, or usually they don't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can be achieved in the protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas, we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision to <unk> which allows them to delete their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle Eastern <unk> for example?
I think that the arts and cinema might be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of Bay Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were going to do with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, it's been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So now we will see why videos are making viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of them does viral with lots of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this particular video outside his house in National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of the past summer.
<unk> didn't get to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a little bit of <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are showing us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   You all want to get the end of a week, the weekend --   <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: So I would not think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael <unk> <unk> <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of <unk> will have a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big joke in your inner joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation animation with a <unk> music.
That's like that, that's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There were <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then he was made.
Suddenly, we came up with a whole community of astronomy that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we can all be part of it.
Because not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What about script might have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video by a minute, only that only single and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't really interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you out properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to make five million saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for all new we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The trend trend agency to participation, totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, of a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't afford permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's hardly the current media, but they are <unk> the entertainment entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so much time friends, now <unk>
They lie in silence.
He died broken for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> beating up to the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was meant to a <unk> task from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat was <unk> to the sea itself of <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the patents and rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother took a <unk> with poison.
If we first looked at it first of it, we'd take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty end.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I did, because of the men in the platform.
No apple had had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class, whose population is comprised of immigrants from <unk>
Unlike the middle class of middle class, whose existence I was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that were coming from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English fragments were being traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car line, working six days.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and the <unk> and a <unk> in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> and he was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something is <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> at the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we ran on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> <unk>
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were going to come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> boys and <unk> were trapped between two worlds.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And they have developed centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classical African student -- relentless <unk> with what it was about myself.
On the other, it was <unk> in everyday lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, abuse and <unk>
But many received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer, I was elected by the American <unk> of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges don't <unk>
It was so <unk> resident on <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to talk about places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got up the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you won't be what you didn't like.
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more I was quite frankly -- I was able to talk about it to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what we were living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a newly new sibling in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear.
<unk> they wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
So we would have a small group of people who <unk> <unk> <unk> was a responsible challenge.
For a year we had no <unk>
At the end of each day, it would make a giant soup of soup that all of us <unk>
They were going to go to a time at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
The 17 became a <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't have it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure that we were still with it.
The night a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why is her hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we were built, we can now see that the men that had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of how easy the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give you a little bit of it, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the old <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days, when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
And at that time when we had the great prince of the Indian warrior Indian warrior -- he had <unk> it took a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic, <unk>
From my grandfather my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this <unk> technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras get out of it.
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a device that was able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, animation and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs in <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a number of moments it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live alive because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My little little little girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always a <unk>
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And they really light up your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and each world turns into a <unk> that I would join this magical device inside the device.
And it opens up a map.
In all there of fantasy has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they are also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another really important aspect of me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing it back into a child child history.
In a story that it is about current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with the technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual of childhood the time you have to go out and on a chapter, I put a picture of a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
In this way, it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
Within the various variants of the <unk> the Earth and the technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we had an interaction where you get out with the iPad and video video and through augmented reality and through augmented reality -- you see a cartoon of cartoons that appear on the inside plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves it.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature will spread with technology and magic and technology will come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or perhaps not all of all, but most of the <unk> projects are going to be able to listen to you.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I got <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is from weight, not at the same time in which I need to need assistance assistance or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before it comes up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure is used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move to the people of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it's going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a little device.
And people are going to come from their homes, to take their blood pressure <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face as the firing of the health care costs -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video of you.
We all have navigation <unk>
Maybe we have our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked ourselves, but no one is <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public. You see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in the <unk> and other people are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> actually <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and for weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to look at the global level.
We're <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us to validate these <unk>
You could be a message messaging or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please take advantage of this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photography <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my early passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a <unk>
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like dark <unk> dark and colorful at the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can get, but I always want you to seem to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem true.
Are you the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is your perspective.
But at the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and you put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, let's get to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic and I think they're not even <unk> the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are located with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect dream.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
So you might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And I think in the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that comes to you because you don't need to put the ideas that has on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, even I did red the house of the top of the island to find more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome, I think it needs to be planning.
It always starts with an idea.
And then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, can you <unk>
This is a diagram anybody I took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details about the details of the general side.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk>
Here's something strange.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, let's say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to look at the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport is as fast as the last <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be on Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development that every few years progress from magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- if you look at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe I'm going to do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would be in the middle of a transition now.
This line is a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way to adopt the world?
How new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still in 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that is going on.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all going to be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't have any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that is going to have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer games.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at each billion years.
So let's go back about a couple and two billion years when the Earth was a very sterile rock with many chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that they organize these chemicals we made a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, I had floating some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate out of the outside of the outside and <unk> grew up.
And they started divide.
In a sense, those were the <unk> mobile forms, those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So each <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time of introducing the chemicals to build -- they grew more chemicals and <unk> more.
Often they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things become interesting <unk> when these drops learned the trick.
In some ways we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, the same <unk> system.
In fact, every living person is expressed with exactly the same collection of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did, we can only write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> you'd have put it in a virus, and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was a interesting step.
This made these cells have been happy about a billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things are very interesting about the things that are very different -- and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information to forming the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that were in a way, and there were a <unk>
From that way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful -- all the individuals in that community will become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came up so that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board into a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that have communities -- communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't have alone.
The skin cell is not serving without the heart of the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary <unk>
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism tried to learn not to eat any fruits because he knew bad and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures completely accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals figured out the trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea of <unk> in your head.
I'm sitting here sitting emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated and we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we have started to do abstractions.
Now we went through periods of periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you about took a billion years every one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as electronics, it seems to be only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that we work for <unk> would not be possible without the historical <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor does every single machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the <unk> designers -- we thought about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that makes it something that was before it wasn't done, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using together, is the evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a hundred million sequences.
You could run these particular instructions at random, and to run all those programs, and take those that are more attached to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to a number of numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they better did the <unk>
Do you get those and <unk> the rest.
And now <unk> the ones that are better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analogous to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and that the children will have the properties of both these programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, cover the <unk>
Let's go back again.
It will be some mutations in it.
And it tries to try again and do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in a few hours, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that will be absolutely perfect <unk>
In fact, it's much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to try and see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But do you get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on doing this.
I was going to go in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and pull out a card and say, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> you have hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than that produces normal engineering.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
That means <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a time analogous to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this begins with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give a part of my false focus on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, it's coming up with the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talk about the statistics and use them to form a great team of baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game of the game without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to get it to the first base -- not coming to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the <unk>
Well, really, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 strokes, <unk> four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the <unk> State League player in run more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to do this to my medical world where I feel so much more <unk> or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place -- and one will be dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 percent.
But do you know anything?
She's getting better in a year in this year.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you think must be the average of hits a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
Very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is <unk> the world, and I included, with the petition to be perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman Sachs was a <unk>
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of the United Nations hospital in Toronto, and not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
My kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis and the <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you get it, it would know everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because this is how I get rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady <unk> to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to talk to a cardiologist I had to go to that patient.
I was reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which <unk> me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart leaves the work and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, and these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started to work on the treatment that was <unk>
We gave <unk> and medication and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water, so that it could eliminate it.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him home.
I actually made two more mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get a constant.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second error I made was worse.
When you send it home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner phone, which was saying, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't you <unk>
In fact, I was so sure that until I asked the nurse to care about the <unk> <unk> <unk> who is okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought about and then said <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as it was yesterday.
So he was <unk> and the ambulance next with the ambulance who took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach.
But I kept with my work.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot, where my car was in order to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't do is normally, at that time.
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there was another nurse, not that I was taking care of the old lady before, but another one, I was saying three words -- those three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear it as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients.
The three words are: you remember you?
"He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At an hour of having come home, after I gave him the loud, he suffered a collapse, and his family called the <unk> the <unk> who brought him to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock shock of it.
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave drugs to raise your blood pressure.
He got a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that he never <unk>
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And to the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the next weeks ago, I was reminded of it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture and I sat by himself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more made that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
Shame is what I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I was doing things and he made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> I know why I made a mistake that <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened up the sky and finally went out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to make the efforts to be perfect to not make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so he did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an hour in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I received a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little <unk>
He would give him penicillin and sent it back home.
But while he ran to the door he was still pointing at his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> change, my boss, asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he said the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
He came back and I had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but from the top, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He was, fortunately, not <unk>
It was <unk> antibiotics on it <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same kind of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same shift in the emergency turn of the emergency shift -- not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it would be used to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
He would have an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking out the patient -- some sensitivity in the bottom right upper and called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
And I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I checked it up and when you notice some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner -- called the surgeon.
They both went operated and they recovered very well.
But every case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't come and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tell me what's really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, you think I'd have a hard time to look at it in the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
Real denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that I don't want to sleep and the ones that I know -- the ones who have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one of 10 drug drugs happen in the hospital are wrong, or the <unk> is not right. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, <unk> <unk> <unk> by medical errors <unk>
The Institute of Medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the patient with a pain in the chest, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes and <unk> to alcohol and suddenly my story <unk> <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars, not <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us -- and we remove all the professional professionals tend to error, well, not getting anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's already a custom and say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, -- "What are your <unk> And they <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down to the head and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to count their stories, they want to share them.
They could say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> human is human, they accept it, and it won't be proud of their mistakes, but it will be hard to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a love and support way that they were all <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, we would make mistakes better.
I feel so much but I was effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently I made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose a half a half a half a day.
Not a lot ago in research followed by a week to a group of schools in business.
The researchers used the different tasks for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about their elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you do the way that we manage those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I do a question, like my blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 types of fruits and vegetables and 25 of them -- and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself why I never buy nothing?
This is the oil shelf <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in a box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
Once I decided to visit the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed up to me the full <unk> of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
They had a <unk> <unk> right at the entrance to the tent.
We put out there six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we see two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had <unk> a <unk> that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent had been six, we saw 30 percent.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six, that if they were in 24.
Well, I decide that we don't buy <unk> it's probably a good thing to keep in the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> problem affects us in <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, in between a million Americans, in this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of hours of funding available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people save for the future.
And we found that I really know there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans for two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of hedge funds was less participation.
So if you look at the end of the extreme, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the 50th 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more choice, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the more the number of options, more people will be able to avoid actions or investment funds.
As soon as it was more choice, they were more willing to invest in market capital.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the welfare financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three negative negative consequences of offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we will make the decision that <unk> even when this is against the interest itself.
It's more likely to take the world's worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively you know it better.
The main reason is that we were going to look at that whole variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to make them contrast and choose from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've never heard that before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today, than now.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut rid of strange <unk> choices -- there will be a <unk> increase in sales, the costs will have a better experience in choice.
When I was <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, they saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and cost.
You know that the banks of today, in average they provide 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there's a 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle the choices is the <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard.
All the employees from Harvard are automatically <unk> to a daily fund.
Those who really want to choose to have 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees cannot <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with everything on the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to do it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
Are you not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I would actually hear more hands.
All right.
They actually had more information in the first <unk> than in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique of driving the problem of the choices that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when you use debit cards when you use a job that when they use yet.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look real, it can be <unk> it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So to that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give the staff to the staff who would think about the positive things that would be involved in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent of 20 and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in the middle supermarket <unk> the show of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because rating tells me how to <unk>
So these are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the left on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the left on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
<unk> must tell you something to be <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk>
What are you supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than what we think about, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision <unk> buying a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that lets <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that give each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I'm 56 possibilities.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order of which decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors, about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a little choice, four boxes, 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?"
How far you are.
If you get to <unk> the default button on each decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was alter the order where the information comes together.
If we started the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though the pick box of change is not going to say anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways being made to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices that we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
You had to register a piece of text from example written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they were written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint until the idea of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would be, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer in any big manufacturer and print one page, that page is going to end up having a few yellow print on each page that you follow a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use the technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you see what happens in the online world, we can put their attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> city in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phones is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, a huge amount of numbers.
There are really many instances of <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online but they do it by illegal media by <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a computer <unk>
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> account of this gentleman -- Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely that any of us is likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong in worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of bombers that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moving, they increase the protests, the protests, the protests, the opinions, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate you.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the heart attacks.
Those are the three main bombers the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the U.S. governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands -- or actually it was.
<unk> the collapse last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives and asked one of the leaders if you were to say, <unk> the death of people who are causing the death to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign foreign authority a foreign <unk>
They would <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> the <unk> secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the building, the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was the notes of a company based in Germany that had been sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept great scale the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool.
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, Western governments provide them tools for governments to make this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected of a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think closely about things like this obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could have a trust in our governments today in 2011, any right, that we will have to be in forever.
Are we going to attend to any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that are worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like the <unk> migrate off the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed by the night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it, I was very bad because it was the only driver's seat, we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were dying of the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were giving them fear.
But I realized that it didn't really be <unk> because even helping lions to see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were like, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come out.
And I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that will turn up and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
They did everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights down.
And as you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had trouble with the lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that were killed and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by all Kenya, for frightening to the other predators like <unk> <unk> and also being used for <unk> elephants in the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and installed lights into the houses that they have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes fly, and I was saying that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I had a chance to come in a plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and lions can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting a story is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a Richard Richard <unk>
CA: You're working on other electrical achievement.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one close electrical <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know you've invented electrical fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: So I would take you a time, right? And I tried to do it before, but I tried to do it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of cannon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to go through every step that <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would happen all of my life in North Korea, until everything changed from suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague of mine.
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family are going to be in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of past.
We're <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As soon as I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a little kid in her arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one was <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
An enormous famine went straight to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived they would eat grass, insects and insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights in the sea except by the lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, <unk>
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the 1950s, I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also, because the refugees North America were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to an awful destination in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was standing in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum in <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be <unk> at a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be able to be able to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South dollars.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the college exam to college.
Just when I started <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities <unk> some money that sent my family, and, as blame, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location removed in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, and I had to do it in a way, for over three kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost we were caught several times.
One time, our bus was stopped and talked about a police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but I certainly believed me.
We did all the way up to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all of the free to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at the very short <unk> of South Korea.
I was going and came between the office office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for other two North Koreans and <unk>
I went to her with all my heart, and I said, "Why would you <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the people <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic time in my life.
The kind unknown would be a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when they were more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But to get their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they traveled to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us still keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that are helping change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North <unk> across the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is Center for <unk> shops to rapid food, fast, <unk> land.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to the Los Angeles and as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South   <unk> from <unk> fast food, terrain.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a desert desert, Los Angeles South Africa, home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
What's curious is that the places of food to bring kill more people than the food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house you see the effects of the current food that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as a car <unk>
I see centers of <unk> <unk> as <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I already got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has no <unk>
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 to me x three me.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to deal with it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was like I decided to keep it right.
So my group and I, L.A. Green -- we put us together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine vegetables, <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of group paid by extension, made by gardeners of all the world's <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city sat down on top and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became criminal order.
And I was saying, "Come on, right?
A judicial order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody else would be <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
And Times was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called, to say, <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more terrain.
It has <unk> <unk> of <unk> land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plants.
Why does the hell don't seem like this?
<unk> a plant -- 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
And I was fascinated by being part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
Just like an artist <unk> that <unk> walls, I was <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get rid of what the Earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
They get rid of how it affects the kids.
The gardening is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
They get <unk>
I remember one time, who came up with a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt like they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me, and this only <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh God no, I have no fear that you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what this is about.
I want you to take it, but at your time, I want you to hold your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los <unk>
They were these guys who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how it used to plant with his mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing up, they will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> you'll eat <unk>  But if none of this will be taught if you're not taught how the food is affecting the mind and the body, eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, which is not going nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are being able to train these communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into a healthy endeavor.
I didn't care about me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to work out to work at people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy of pride and pride and honor to grow their own food, opening markets in farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you're not called to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace <unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  Probably everybody will agree with me that this is a very <unk> road.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
They can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that we were going to.
And especially if you go on your bike on your bike and these cars go, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads <unk> roads.
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, it has pores and water can pass through it, so all of the water water flow down to the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't have any water ever anymore.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise -- all the noise -- so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disappears of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones <unk>
First of them was a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and they will be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they are <unk> and if you get <unk> they will be <unk> and they were separating from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool <unk> of steel, that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> in very small bits, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have a little bit asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at it.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the flow of the flow of these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used an oven, <unk> oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried lots of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So we got a piece of roads, 400 feet of the highway highway where we had to make a lane test to test this material.
So that was what we did in there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made aging -- we put a lot of burden on them, and we put them together with our <unk> machine, and we knew them and we went back to it.
We can repeat that many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel, steel fibers these fibers, to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, to actually increase the life of the road, and you can even double the life of the surface. They can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you're curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it does it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing News News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban broke my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
I will never forget it.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made girls to school.
For the next five years, I was fascinated by a little kid to get to my older sister that I could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could do it.
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could be <unk> where they were <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so it looks like we shopping away.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us who were in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we had our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, school was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan, Afghanistan, where his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to convert our house to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can <unk> you to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate at <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who drove him through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What I see is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the friend, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of an opposition as a <unk>
As <unk> it's not your real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed it's the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb in the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now, if he said, "but I won't hurt the future of my daughter for his old <unk>
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who are <unk> there is a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of change.
We were able to get these changes in a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you will never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> from the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and out of the country to call a day of rage and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women, and young men were <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> bravery in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war, and a loss of about 50 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the culture of the moral <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted, along with many other women, rebuild civil civil society -- <unk> a transition and just to democracy and national <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm began to organize workshops about the development of capabilities, and skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> a movement of women, leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy autonomy of the woman and for our <unk> right to the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the developing period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little to little bit, the elation of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news of violence.
We woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques ancient and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the murder of the murder <unk> and the attack <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> <unk> of human rights for prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up by a <unk> mindset, and it gets away from the ideal and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice -- we had social justice.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all of us today to do with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
So I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose badly, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the election didn't get peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> they brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society continues to <unk> and dominated with negative policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus than I needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the feminine performance of the most likely to need the <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as <unk> and <unk> days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not just <unk> but also put the <unk> instead of <unk> the collaboration in place of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions that are the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which involves all the humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all of the villages have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
And so you say, "My <unk> is <unk>
So it tells us, "My <unk> prevalent about my <unk>
What they were going to do is that we all have the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a mathematical question that has a equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody makes a good thing. Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I was just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, the guy who loved one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for <unk> companies, <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all of the religion, all of our income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we want or expect to find <unk> which is why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was left with a man who sticks it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands -- abusive <unk>
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence, domestic signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a college of the <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about in that first encounter was that I was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field.
He had some big <unk> and <unk> and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did -- from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me, which I was ready to Harvard, I was going to Harvard, who was passionate about helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> I believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York City and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought he had to do for your partner, and so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head at a physical trap financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how they react to it.
And here is where they come into the scene of those guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to feel so safe was bought three guns.
One had in the <unk> of the car.
Another kept her underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed these guns to cause the trauma that lived in a row.
I needed them to feel secure.
But these guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never had my hand, my life, my life was already at serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit, and I married him.
Despite what I had occurred, I was confident that we were living happy forever, because I loved him, and he wanted a lot to me.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had a very good sense of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of being a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and it would never be more harm.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I wrote several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> followed by one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk>
So, actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us to face their <unk>
The other question everyone else does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you have, is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killing in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim to be end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family justice system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend a man who would go to their mother.
And yet we continue asking why it's simply not <unk>
I was able to go down, because of one last <unk> I was able to beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, if it had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, to the United States, to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are going to tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims like <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is yours by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally intentionally want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> that they learned a shared lesson from what happened to them and that <unk> their lives and joyful lives as <unk> wives and mothers, fully free violence like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and an survivor of a very typical domestic violence.
And I came to <unk> with a cute little guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to you will ever be more, would ever be a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, they are just thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now that are being <unk> or they are being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love of love by breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives on silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their jobs of work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
We were able to get the active signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims out safe <unk>
Together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis -- secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment, there is an awkward tension in the room because it shouldn't have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when you get older, you don't have to get them right now, but to find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
And these seconds are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to go through the head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this photo, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he <unk> the back and <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days for work, there's very little ago that we can do to transform our looks, which, but shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I am a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, "A <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last few centuries we not only defined beauty as well as health and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and we can shape it, and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've learned to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown to be <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, they would be able to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York -- he told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and <unk> models -- just <unk> -- to say, less than four percent, were not white ...
The next question that people always ask me is, can it be a model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be model, I mean, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or American <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the surgical surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've done your studies, and you have a resume and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you would think about -- I mean, if you think you want to be president of the United States, but your copy <unk> <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all of the photos were <unk>
And yeah, virtually the photographs, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was excited about, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and I never use, except the couple of things before, but the privileges I get to be the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I forgot to take the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> an <unk> agent in order to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges because of my way, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their act without mind who they are.
I live in New York City, and the past year of <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent of them were black and Latino men and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I was <unk> And <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit smaller, and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I would like this.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's only one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair, to be more happy?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most likely legs, the brightest hair and the <unk> clothes, but they probably are the physically <unk> women, the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to keep in this talk, I hope that everyone will be more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much older enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't know the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum care of lighting in light.
In fact, most of them were taken out at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me out of this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
I just happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me into New York on a <unk> journey, and you go on the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to make us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with it.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
Recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly it was stopped in the dry and pointed out of a red <unk> of the string of dolls that were small in previous visits before.
And he described to me what was five years on the same place.
<unk> that reminded his heart of the heart of the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively involved in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't want to get up to someone and ask him, and you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter <unk> as <unk> silly <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They are hardly <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of those 16, 11 faced with a high risk of extinction.
So, why are they <unk> first of all, providing vital ecological services for vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria help absorb anthrax that would not be for them to melt and cause huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times in <unk> and this has huge ramifications on the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and Under Egypt.
In the mythology we <unk> <unk> the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're doing very important <unk> in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural waste system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of the <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and the <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India, and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs on the number of <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb bomb, the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against nuclear energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there's a terrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see they travel by different countries, so to focus on a living problem is not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help yourself, can make noise.
When you get out of this room, you will inform them on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw it flying without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these marvelous species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all I would have to do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided we decided to teach the people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got with the seeds of <unk> the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local to grow tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people weren't at all people who were doing that, so what they were telling you to come to work, and some times, they weren't <unk>  We were reminded that local trees in such an fertile valley, had never been agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we could not <unk> -- we simply said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> to the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Zambia, of this size.
And we didn't believe that we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk> is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything --  and we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? You're never <unk>
I thought that only we had the Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did -- what the English did, what the French did, and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave up to <unk> people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm that money has <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just from two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root of the Latin root that means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the side of the face -- "The Little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, <unk> you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just get 27 years to respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you never have motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does this you? Are you <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee bar. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for one time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they would give them -- but not <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in your community, you don't even know this because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work in face -- you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor, the medical doctor who sets up with you in your house at the kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western prison.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage where we got to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And --  So the government says, <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I got involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business of business.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their power.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to give you a <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What do you talk about you have been more <unk>
Ordinary local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossil <unk> and at one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a particular story that I read in a magazine magazine -- many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> he got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City -- wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population holds up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in fact, in the United States there were <unk> generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then you will have to tell you about the truth with respect to <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be able to do, selling and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born.
We have studied and looked at the 100 companies of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> Ford all new companies, <unk> <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: none of them was started by one person.
That word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
No one begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business <unk> in bars with their dedicated situations.
What can you? Can you do it?
All right, you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You know, you look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay to borrow more things without calling the door at a <unk>
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more hopes for cows in the cows for our communities to be able to reflect our communities today, our <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that they give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> from a few centuries ago, and I trust a city.
It always <unk> the music.  There's a <unk> <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most American <unk> properties.
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a better space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
He's sudden the death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the living time.
He gave him clarity to the significant things of my current life.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be easy to be able to catch the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I turned the wall of this house left on a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases for <unk> Before they died <unk>
So the <unk> they could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be tested by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing to millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you more and more."
Before I died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people asked me to laugh at me, and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that one is not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways, and <unk> it's about giving to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I began to get hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues of the civic center we did a kit, and now they've been in walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces, if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions that is increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of conserving the perspective and remember that life is very short and very interesting.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that will become more power.
And if you think about death -- we have our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share the fears and stories, the people around us not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very <unk>
Don't speak, but transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
<unk> shares what happens to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice in this: it's never <unk>
When they sing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I didn't even even know -- I could remind me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel it's 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year I came out every year of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, <unk> in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday birthday.
Isn't that cool?
But most people don't.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of a society, and they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was autistic <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication to learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> it's so different to Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or no cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived alive and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and there was pleasure in the smallest things like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that there was between <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and frustration and <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normality.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that anyone is wrong.
It only means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take you a single thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your interior, and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change die at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a communications professor, which would give a kind of communication to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their big minds, their great books and their great <unk> words.
But when they develop those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had these conversations with the students, and I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and care of health, between others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see the wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get to <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of wiring and <unk> with their content.
And when I present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they're called <unk>  What do you do? The bullets are killed, and the bullets are killed, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's actually supporting too much in the language of our brain and we are <unk>
In contrast, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then it will provide graphics that will give our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they would be.
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open door to the door and look at the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, because of all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an <unk> editor in the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that it searches a public charge without mind -- and that when I won, it gets through the mere use of a monumental basis, <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the very unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put him on the Tower of London, and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the <unk> <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to America just after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, your leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some simply wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King of a fixed term.
And there could be <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> "Not with this <unk>
What caused by <unk> and <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call him King if he would give him to him or to her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give you the most <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was already before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> out of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will be serious with a title as <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> as a title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep <unk> waiting for years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you that the title of President of America doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the history of the <unk>
So in the end, I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern from the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to do with it.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually actually change it much more than the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in a illegal Ghana in Ghana.
The air is filled with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that they speak about, but mostly that cacophony of male <unk> and stones <unk> <unk> tools.
Like the other hand, I carry a cheap light flashlight on the head with this rubber line, and I can barely tell the branches of the branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I had my hand and I suddenly remember a <unk> I met a car that I met recently -- who lost control and fell half feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole risking their lives without paying a reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they may never will, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Summit <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has been interested in eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not in a degree.
When we end up talking to me, I was very bad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> your stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offered my help.
So it started my journey to slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some of the even, I considered the second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as many displaced Africans during all of the slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk> <unk>
However, today you can enslaving entire families by generations for <unk> budget for 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over <unk> 13 billion a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false education promises and better work to then find out that they are forced to work without improving under threat of violence and they cannot escape.
Today slavery operates on the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal in the world.
In India, and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange, formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a <unk> temperature temperature, men, children, in fact, families -- <unk> families -- in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their head, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, making this task again and over 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no lunch to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> was made to pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and <unk> and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my side quickly -- he grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it." Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
You couldn't give any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not a citizen of that country.
Could you put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their release and he trusted that he was <unk>
As much to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children they were dragging stones for miles on <unk> <unk> up to <unk>
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who were carried on and the children -- their heads on their head and <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something such <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16  17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers save their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual traffic -- and because of this global awareness consciousness, they warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
It took me out of the stairs <unk> that gave this basement <unk> <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse in their hands of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> fear and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be got caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I was born.
There was no <unk> doors.
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a subject so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people going into agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
textiles is another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there was entire families in which it had been involved in the <unk>
This is a family family.
The black hands of black are the father, the blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, being able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to check a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishing family on one boat, two older brothers -- some more young children, some more young kids, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families and they were eating them and they were forced to work extensive in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was a theme that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run away and, like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries to get the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were following the last networks, but they had been working from the one way.
At the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will get to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> with the <unk> a fellow <unk> and they suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to do it by a road from land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would be able to get out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos on my head as I went through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and, while they were looking for gold gold, <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet, and these people carry them with heavy stone bags that then they'll be able to go to another area where the stone was able to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer on the side of the side, you see the other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> would end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him on mines.
When your uncle, die <unk> I inherit the debt.
When I met him, I had worked in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has been released with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, from face-to-face to a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on the <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them and to do everything we could to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can look at each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not aware of people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I'm going to happen that I don't think of these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them -- and I hope that that force will turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management management.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later.
But tonight demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill -- and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component that well.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a <unk> <unk>
In the last few years, it has made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is actually a cure being when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement have no biological <unk> so they don't have the <unk> and the best thing we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic doing it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could make the test <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is I want to tell you as a conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least -- we're all <unk> as my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows somebody as well as it emits sounds like a <unk> of an vocal bolt because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we need the <unk> <unk> for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think of time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal ropes as <unk> and as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom line you can see an example of the irregular shake of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they both are <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole host of hospitals to do it.
They both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're at minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it looks at massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the problems of the patients.
They don't need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
With high-speed monitoring we could get goals.
We could make a massive massive cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative of Parkinson's disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's disease, you can call it low price and <unk> for some cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thanks.
What about these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Right.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big show of data on the different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at the <unk> the confusion of confusion of the actual <unk>
TR: Do you have a <unk> of accuracy at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has made a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, but what we did -- the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the darkness, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We do the static models still more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- we do the impossible, and we were going to get it into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March March of 2011, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where an organization was <unk> -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level recorded hit over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the ground.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
We took the schools -- we removed the mud and we leave the ready ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took six tons of fish and tons of fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We love us and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and <unk>
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the villages around the way to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that these people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> toilets -- big, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there was the honor of that day and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I moved beyond myself as my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some who had over a hundred years of some of them were still in the lab about the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on Facebook, contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had caught the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they got a little bit more <unk> and they had more <unk> and it became more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the historical libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time that we were in <unk> is a different story: depended on of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a weeks.
It could be a months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures of water in seawater, covered from bacteria, with algae, and even oil -- all of it along the time of the time I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless they were clean <unk> and it would have been <unk> by their <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We have the guidance of a neighbor <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more pictures.
As once once said, the leader of my group is as a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had kind of kind of kind of kind of like the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped when you realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would have no <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in one photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When he collected their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues from her husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble between the rubble -- quite far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk> it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
It took a week to find a whole week to find all his family and know that everybody was survived.
The day I gave her his son his son under 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could tell you something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that had not been marked by the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up more than <unk> and <unk> photographs -- the great majority came back to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 families and hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take off, but the first thing we would take to look for.
This was the project of the project, to restore little pieces of humanity, to return to someone with a connection to the past.
When a photo comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something larger, I'll give you something, using their talent for something that is not a perfect skin model.
So I would like to read this email. I sent him Cindy day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women in the day of the grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the minute our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> inspired me and curious with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go over a million times faster and seeing the world not a million or a thousand frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in the slow motion of the light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X, <unk> and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and turned it up and put it into a <unk> of a second or a number of <unk> to create a package of photons in just a millimeter of wide wide <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we shoot it in this bottle, how they disperse those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola wouldn't have this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the top, and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel around the table, and because of the insights of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current bullet and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow enough to about 10 billion times, how much you think that would take us to sit in that movie?
One day? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And what about trying to test <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato wall and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, and I was thinking about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of laughter.
But if you look at the top of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light goes off of the tomato <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light goes on its interior and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo on the top, it comes very little light in.
But we're going to go up a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so I just get into some light.
<unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over and over and over and over and again with a very fancy <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible there.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, at a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances down to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
By projecting a laser you can record a <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we be able to see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that make cars, with what's going on the curve, the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the interior of the body <unk> <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite hard, so actually this is an order for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality modality in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became a science in art, an art of photographs of pictures.
I realized that all of the data data that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can know.
To create a new form of computing photography, with slow <unk>
And let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of second.
But here's something fun here.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you get away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order that events happen in the world are often invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
<unk> Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change your life, and it gives you freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can have a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
So with a cell phone, you can record a song -- you know, <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people have been looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people are going to be able to get a change, you have a mobile phone in our pocket.
Who on behalf have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everyone has a mobile phone.
But I'm going to talk today about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data information.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> of the E.U. introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider -- has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text.
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your phone <unk>
And across Europe people were planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone phone -- and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, they all said, "We want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, who please get to <unk> all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
<unk> demand and they would send me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 percent of information.
When I first saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> of data means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization for six months of my life.
You can zoom in and stay backwards and forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> in the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
But all of us.
First of all, there is things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other what time they communicate to each other, what time you go to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who you speak to who, who send him an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk>
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight the self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to come home to their friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not past fashion.
When you go home, you're going to come back to their representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, let's guess what?
It's not enough.
Hello, let's guess what?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral <unk> that's why we have <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk>
It's not <unk> or <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, and they are.
It's only about accidents, as the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of us in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you want to be a disabled person.
Let's go walk.
<unk> on Christmas, they are at the shopping center, driving in circles and <unk> and what do you see?
16 empty places for the disabled.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I mean, I have 99 problems, and P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, who live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the "Don't se puede" question.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three biggest sisters will be <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents will come to the school system and <unk> that I was also going, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years to put my <unk> on their feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used to use was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I was <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong, and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 and still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
The people who grew up there were no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of a lot of hunger to die of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat fat to live three months without eating any eating, so <unk> the dawn at sunset at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all of us -- we were going to lie in <unk>
On the summer vacation I often was often about <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and I was blown away in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that he couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can do it in your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the very positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to <unk> University of Arizona, because it went on all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
Everyone <unk> me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene of the glass zoo of my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called a very slow <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming about four <unk> <unk> I would have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end.
Thank God <unk> in the end, I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying -- historically, it as if someone would have killed my cat, asking me why and she told me that because they believed that I could not do the stunt scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for which it literally was born and gave it to an actress without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> <unk> actors for disabled papers.
When I went home, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was as extra as a <unk>
My dream got true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't look at me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that <unk> <unk> actors are not white, <unk> <unk>
They just want perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took comics famous from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell at the fact that I was at high speed on the New Jersey freeway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it very funny.
In 2003, my mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media and at the time remind the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program on the wire on the wire back with Keith <unk>
I walked down as if I went to a graduate dance, I sat down to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to me at the desk desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not have a living.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like a full-time participant and taped my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get rid of me and <unk>
All of a sudden, my online disability became <unk>
I could call online clips <unk> "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What the disease have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair you can't do <unk> then you can't do someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors were saying not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think that <unk>
I hope together we could create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there would be more happy images, that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the society to teach our children.
My tortuous journey has taken me to a very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of soap <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity organization to give Palestinians children a small part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know your name, but I know your story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This town is about <unk>
<unk> drives the little people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, no job, no perspectives of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read about a guy who offers him to <unk> it after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to their family.
He's presented to a young boy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the big city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were at the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start in their future, hoping for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that took it out of what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> <unk> young urban urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to the violence, to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being at the hospital in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never got gone?
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to actually support these juvenile leaders on a business list.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rainwater of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because I was a graduate college college student -- frustrated, was the perfect white thing for Al <unk> and other organizations in terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
She started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with your family help and friends, and his dream is at some point to rise to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I believe that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the overseas.
If you beat somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
Those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
She started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
He created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery delivery for me to create gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he <unk> <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit -- it's really a great step, but young people need the capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to guide them in development and put it in their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park in <unk> That's how it is called, when it is created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of <unk> a <unk> area in New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were able to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- white paper balls and <unk> balls.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy as to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where you <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and it's about 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products -- every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I interviewed people in offices and interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need to get more to more.
So I started working as <unk> <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And we <unk> the mechanical <unk> and bar the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
Everybody asks the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- it will be <unk>
It costs a lot of used to get used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of taking on their body and <unk> all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of FBI <unk> the waste of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
Are you going out and moving into the traffic all day and move around around you.
They only want to tell you, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of the nature itself.
They never stop coming.
It's also a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> their containers and their dangers inherent at us in very real ways.
We had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old -- we don't have space for how new the economics engines start to fail when it's in danger of the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to <unk>
And then it's what I call our average speed of daily speed.
With that, I mean just the speed that we used to get used in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get rid of it, and we have been cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them. We forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that you would take from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste of waste that maybe help you reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste fishing truck in the street, grabbed my little son and went down the <unk> and there was a man doing her journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you about doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and he just said, "Let's get it right.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the waste of waste and went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have to be able to find all the costs, even the very actual human cost of the labor.
The city waste, what we think about when we're talking about trash, they are three percent of the nation of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community of thinking about our community in the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects today like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They share the fact that the different analytics from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> is generating heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it is about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third of all, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the score, the site, which is located in a much growing area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist yet.
And it's also between two street streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this extends out with a <unk> atrium -- which creates a space to open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied to the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
And I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that supports the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that is similar to a concrete <unk> <unk> to allow the input to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and the light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building by night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what you want.
But ultimately, we all realized this idea of market was much more profitable than the commercial center because they were in the end of the bank to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity takes almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas and bars that would create this oasis of urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which has been collecting water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention into the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access to the full lines of <unk>
When I went to place, the first operation of design that we did was to expand the streets and create 12 initial blocks similar to the size and features of those in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some <unk> points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation to an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we set up a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density on higher levels and a lower density in the plant down.
And it <unk> this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all of the neighbors, you can go up and <unk> and make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are emerging in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change communities and local economies at the same rate as we grow buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as a target to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright hair quantities, and a little <unk> <unk> was super heavy for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I became a time after the school <unk> I was a little bit later and I hid in the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took from my master's table, he took his grades.
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few like this.
All the same.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the lines of <unk> and myself a row out of it, just because of being there, because it was <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I was never <unk>
It was that everything was <unk>
I would never tell you."
But most of all, I'm going to tell me the reason why I was bothered by this <unk> that was so small to <unk>
It <unk> the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number number one of <unk> murders in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will check the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory that we study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk> there would be no <unk>
There would be no King <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
It would have no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school lists because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost all of them.
This year is going to be 100 years of his work -- "In the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the most <unk> of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forgot about the relentless <unk>
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person -- their wish, in their <unk> are a <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
As a matter of fact, storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
All she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure on the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that could be detected in your lover -- adds to their collection of torture of torture in its private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why it's so successful -- it's so successful --  <unk> links well the <unk> language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in their <unk> agony of course, listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, finding a strong truth, in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the best.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman we need to need, that it makes us realize it causes us to make a whole range of feelings that are much more profound and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
We're telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there is some other excitement that we do with us, this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young young man who was consumed with the idea that her woman was <unk>
And Freud said there was something strange in that man, who was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or not accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> do to look with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are more <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since the one that was sent to be horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when I or this, I reacted with awe.
Because let's be realistic.
How huge even though we need creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel <unk> novel than a novel <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange, bright character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how our minds <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get your self and to tell you what you've ever seen, and it's under the floor -- <unk> your name, carries your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, both as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live on jealousy.
I mean, we're good at social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show <unk> I'm not secure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to Baker <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think in <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always experienced <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> <unk> but <unk>
Oh, <unk> sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> on each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who would not want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. It seems very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a problem with it without emotion.
You know, at a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it still be so bad.
What if <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to <unk>
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction.
Just <unk> <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> them at the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the module module of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the surface surface was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the biggest implicated in time of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to some 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo crew 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on their surface, which came up after the death of Armstrong -- last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> the cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the very words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why is it scaling the <unk>
So 35 years ago, why would you fly about <unk>
Why does it play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a face of the West in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> at the bottom of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great power to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we think that the technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, curing cancer, or feed the world's population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember watching Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we don't get to the tube of escape from the rocket of the rocket of the rocket of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that logic came up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems as if the technologists had <unk> and they had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that they were <unk> <unk> <unk> Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in concrete, the incentives of risk offers to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investment -- tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with the benefit of technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and developing capital that have been long-term in the long term. We have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems, because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we don't solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you are."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy sources like solar and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is absolutely cheap.
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, of entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of an <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in political climate that we will see a energy energy policy or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they turn out not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure on the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are a policy crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we found that there are many types of cancer, some severely resistant cancer types of cancer, and only over the last 10 years seem to have been found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need, but these four elements have to be <unk> and the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability for the technology to solve great problems, it serves with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction -- like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> from our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there's been a great decline in trust, is a very general belief today.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should <unk>
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why are people thinking that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn into opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys surveys throughout time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who have been doing 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago still being quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly in the middle of the way.
But this is the evidence that is enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at is the primary attitudes that people are going to be in the wrong person when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone will be asked to be <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at <unk> teachers.
They probably ask for asking, "What do what?"
And that would be a very intriguing answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain type of official mate, or a type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I have to say that I trust a certain elementary teacher who I know to give the middle class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think polls are very bad tools to measure the real standard of real trust, because they try to deal with the good judgment in fact to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a rational goal.
This is not the goal that I will <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what it's not <unk>
And I think that those people who are doing their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart target in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the raw commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if you are not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't stop in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would be able to get their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do with it to do before you trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and others, who were getting easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is we do the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know some similar examples.
So we did all of that, by the target.
And I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different to be worthy of trust, and we will tell people that we are reliable and if you try to figure out whether other people or officials or political or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions, <unk> <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
So I went to task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the ground enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't catch it -- usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is a daily basis, everywhere, does the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can move them out without making a difference.
I wear them and get the money, or change it for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how other person is <unk>
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've become <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that was <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body to the pixel itself.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole dexterity <unk>
In the Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They had a transparent bombsight with depth of depth to detect your fingers and your face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, to get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can go through the book and try and make it <unk> or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can spread or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we eat in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come into us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned through the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in the space, how we can do that are physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be like this way?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel in the lab.
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D block in the space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that humans can <unk> and go back to reproduce and they stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and a distance away, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can play you as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the <unk> or the textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital data is not only going to show you something but that start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you will, that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was fascinated by becoming a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a <unk> path towards <unk> a safe job and <unk> job.
What if I work to work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer, <unk>
This was me in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I also wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But any adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much older to train.
My dream is never <unk>
So I knew for the rest of my life -- a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> <unk> of Chinese life.
And it is not propaganda that it <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find this with a new culture that was also given to my <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map this map, I thought it was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's a research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of an issue.
And I thought if the comparative reading was working for research, why don't you do it in everyday life.
So I started reading books.
They can be about people who are <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For aging, <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I won't go back or <unk> ever.
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion, the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a college student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex came up to the first session with jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch of my office and took my shoes and told me to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to move the head while they had the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I was saying Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work after, you get home after that, she has children later, until death happens later.
For the <unk> like Alex and I had time to move.
But little later, my <unk> was pushed me to press Alex who talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys under their <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, not no, but maybe they went down with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
So this made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect time and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of recklessness <unk> was a real problem, and it had real unintended consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life but for the careers, families and future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody gets to age age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They are amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove a <unk> and I want to see. It's right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means that eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give your life to you will have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People of more 40, I don't have to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have a exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that over half the American Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now it's the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> on your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time to adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
<unk> were <unk> names of the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
That's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day, interesting <unk> like you or their children come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship isn't true to me, but this relationship won't count, I'm just killing time."
Or you say, "All they say when I start a race before 30, it's all going to be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better lecture on the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out to the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one to be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had a <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of us start a career, to choose a city, to choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> tells you that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see yourself in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said that I'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite having a very hard <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They often get into our sessions, but then they get up to her -- "You don't choose your family, but he can choose their friends."
Well, she got her head on his head on his legs and cried for almost almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he stayed looking at the empty space that goes after the words <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex how to only sit while the <unk> <unk> was going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that it was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity of identity creates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that <unk> that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> exploration, I'm looking at exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I had jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who get together with friends with similar minds, they're limited to who you know what you think about how you think about how they think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or no work.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the shape of the <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job in the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family, when he has a partner and her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit on the head that 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live right now or tell you now when everyone on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have it, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're in work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just do to work or kill time with anyone who is that they <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she came up with a cousin of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped me get a job there.
That work offer was a reason to leave boyfriend with the living that I live.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married one with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of government contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like airplanes that go out from the airport from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in their trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 to <unk> a good conversation, a good deal -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea about spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
This is what now I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get out of identity, use their weak molecules, choose your family.
Don't define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management consulting for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> in the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and evidence.
Let me give you tasks.
When the work was back, I would raise grades.
What struck me about was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade grade -- safe, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After many years more <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
But what if having successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who was <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really hard environments, and what teachers are still going to be teaching for the end of school and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of the learning of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it arose a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination <unk> and then waited for about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had more determination -- even though the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where it matters <unk> also for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know the science about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do development care about children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going to go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related or is even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be able to <unk> when you die, because you don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start all over again with the lessons with it.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my <unk> <unk> the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign -- it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall <unk> China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy <unk>
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> traffic signals, understanding the basic idea of web pages or the paper.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it is possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
<unk>
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person reaches your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> from remember, because a stem tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three minutes together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played there for someone at home?
This person is coming out in a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already spent almost 30 characters.
When you use this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of <unk> which is the same as learning a Chinese <unk>
So after the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun <unk> with the <unk> because Japan is east of China.
So one sun next to us, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the old China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie was <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic dress.
But when you saw that film so many times, you get to understand what's remarkable is extraordinary.
We are now living and we raised our children in a kind of industrial complex show show.
However, the magician <unk> was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a little metal guy, and a guy who was <unk> <unk> a girl dressed in the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like self-fulfilling -- <unk>
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies were made by the computer of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing in the Oz of the Oz is that the most compelling characters and <unk> are female.
I started to notice this when I did Star Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So she was in the room and became impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be about value, <unk> and <unk>
It should be the feeling that Luke did one of an army for overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician of <unk>
How do you make Dorothy your movie?
We're doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with you, right? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of the body capital forces in movies for our children, and so little from the <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of the films of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I don't read so much about how kids react to me to this encouragement.
I know for experience that the princess princess does not give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected to be expected to go out because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing up there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the villain and get their reward, and you don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, boys, are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend them from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies about war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the times continues to show up in classical after classic a child on a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who have a young girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
You remember what criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
Is it very good. Don't let that do that?
Well, almost none of these films passes the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not getting roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the film of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do -- in the film, there are more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else in the kid than they do it.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success from <unk> a consensus sense of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't happen the proof of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the phosphorus crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 movies -- how many of them believe they have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be able to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said.
In the United States, one of every five women said it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of one male hero is to defeat violence, and then you charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools that we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our kids guys a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the role that you care about and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people in order to get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and fight and just more stories where your job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea biscuits at the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would get to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach at Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length.
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the east east of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using false <unk> suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes in the landscape of the caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find a old old city, called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> Nile right next to <unk> and as it changed the time, moved to the east and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball gloves on.
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> is.
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly high that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the African scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation we seek out of the human occupation we seek out of the human occupation we seek out.
Five meters down, underneath a thick <unk> <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
So this means that in this possible location of five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of a number of hundreds of years that date from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what proves there was a <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones that were used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that dates back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but we would take a place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the top of the Roman Empire -- probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do you want the ideas to actually happen in 1984 B.C. <unk> in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the <unk> search for <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> arms race and go in the direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go on the top of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the viability line.
In the lobby, or what the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light -- the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I'm talking about.
They can feel their blue fur, by getting tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you pass it into the mouth.
They went through one side and enter your living room.
Because in the room, and doing most of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his center, singing <unk> <unk> <unk> One more <unk> One <unk>
Now let's go back to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow path, and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and Len of "The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist -- waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
It would take whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize very quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, "You know, when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition is they say they have normal memory.
And we said, we have trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that medieval academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How do I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright English and a little <unk> and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> in national TV.
That would see the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that I had a problem with <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how our memory is doing that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a lot of treaties about the memory of the memory of some more than 2,000 years in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and disciplined memory wasn't just as rare as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed us as well.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems to us that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you find out where people are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is a lot like this in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it having brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive <unk> and the answer was actually really no.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a magnetic resonance machine, <unk> your brains as long as you go through numbers, faces and forms of the snow -- they found that in the memory champions -- different parts of the brain, different to each other.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as an armed career where every year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On your desk, and in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- messy that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
Half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these harsh ways, absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
Here's a fancy paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell you two people who remember the same word, I say it to you -- I mean, there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
Do you know what <unk>
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said that his job is <unk>
Same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. No relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance through their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk> hands.
They get back home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later on.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired them as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't take a <unk> it would be <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was, the classroom of <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed your eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting at each front here.
I took the family members of the <unk> where they were their loved ones between rubble.
What we did have noticed at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and very remarkable spatial <unk>
If you were to tell them that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who you say who was sitting on the horse <unk> brown in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory -- the same way that I would have done it -- if you had been invited to <unk> it for 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy ridiculous, to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year -- and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So it's like the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> don't word for word, which is going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his own memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got involved with it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk>
But seriously, it's like to see a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was kind of fun.
I would never expect that to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about train memory.
What it's actually about doing is better getting more and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses. leaving only two <unk> because the eye is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put together in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this would be a good job for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. They are working on.
Because it's based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories were <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
You know, a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete amount of attention that most of you are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what the <unk> <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose out of what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> you don't pay attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the type of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex thing, so we just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am a row, breathing -- I was at the home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there I spent all of the time watching the television TV, so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everyone looked at me and every time I was <unk> and I would come back into a towel all of me saw.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under top.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it for based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> who uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we have used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build a <unk>
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, solids, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are doing the <unk> and the governments, they always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know that they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing, and some red brick -- that they leave <unk> what you're trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the <unk> the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side, the architects constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new new solutions for the forms of current life.
We were <unk> and we <unk> so much that we get away from the people.
All of the black, we feel that we feel that we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to connect with those <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we really feel like <unk> we make it <unk> we make it <unk> and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
You know, the next thing in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added on top and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took parameter and we turned them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> made from glass.
The shapes are <unk> won by boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time at commercial malls we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, it's easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum going back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and the early '90s, we started to experience with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques in the computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> and it's totally <unk>
Usually the beginning <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, the opened building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public and public and general public was completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> building.
<unk> tourism.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical forms, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The main mayors of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new development went through other star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, it actually started to happen with all the architecture, the digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can see in the newspapers, on TV, and ultimately, we are all of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
They don't really know a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before you know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two years, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to come back to happen, because we're in the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to grow up faster and faster, and it starts to be in both extremes almost <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional load of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product, and there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people started getting and shared in social media, the building stopped being only a building, it became a mode of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can bring the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there's no single answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that you don't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it through the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick of red brick with ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will spread into the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami in Miami in Florida, it can also serve for sports or for <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream in swimming in the New York City of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> as <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not only reflecting our society, but they shape the most <unk> spaces of the local libraries the households where we formed our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it in a great way, the typical children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They laugh and <unk> and it gives himself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
I mean, apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do this. And so when do you stop doing this?
How do we suddenly aren't <unk> with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google. "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it has 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite his mom telling him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow people say, you don't know who to believe.
So a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think of them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager who gets these answers on one of the stages of their most emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it pushing to do this?
Well, teens are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving myself <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, just as young as young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party party in his room all <unk>
There's simply not privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, we're always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of yourself likes and the types of comments that they get.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what's <unk> <unk>
What is the ultimate in life of someone in front of you who are normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> keep <unk>
The <unk> technique is a routine.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people want to?
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars, of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow up and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to <unk> the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of 10 girls would rather do something because they think you don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as a <unk> society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to participate in the classroom because they don't want to call the attention of their physical thinking.
One of five are not <unk> at all sorts of lessons at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see you good enough if you don't think you're thin, you put a note down to the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
It gives up irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, in order to be good, of course, we're talking about you -- not how you really are.
The low self-esteem in his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet -- healthy than they can bring them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all over this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets -- <unk> surgery, aesthetics, sexual relationships -- early age -- and without protection and harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher <unk> rates.
<unk> percent of women don't present to a day interview in one day that they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we have to instill confidence in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are still not only going to have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anyone willing to provide a education in your body self-esteem that works.
A education is a difference, but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as they see.
And all of us can start to make the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can connect people based on their effort and their actions and not look at their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time I had a <unk>
So in short, we have to work together as communities, such as governments and our businesses, to truly change our culture, so our children will grow their children to grow the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen because we can only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they believe that they think you're never going to see the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who is in your mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in your interior, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a <unk> belly <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to put this up and we would be able to make the potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the imagery is holding us all.
But let's go to our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is only a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year from a year of age today, are becoming security agents in themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense of Defense <unk>
In fact, they were initially rejected by <unk> but being a prisoner for other charges and a company of others, they started planning attacks from about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans was <unk> by an FBI informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, was unable to avoid.
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who did all the possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very many of the Muslims are going to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want to wish the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there's always a little fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we need to use all the means that they all lived as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the last week in a week, he and some friends, had been going to training on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point to the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot shot gave to the little orange light on the goal and for surprise of all, especially of me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
From such a father, such child.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they seemed as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't let me do a lot of them.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone who was a time of packing and get to another city.
As I was always my new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but it will be the new of the silent class and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was spending in my house reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> it was not prepared for the real world.
So we raised my opera to judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way of thinking, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program, which I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a <unk> victim almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys had made anyone who had made friendship, was Jewish was <unk>
I took several days to go out of the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I was really proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in the Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is from being homosexual but I know what is going to be done by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me honest and honest about my <unk> and I was helping me see the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my focus on a moment when I was desperately excited.
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that conserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
And she looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
He changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better path. That even though I was fascinated by this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak to these acts without meaning, as a rejection of my father.
So with this simplicity I'm shown here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- which kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
You have a film and taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hunger will be.
It has emotion, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that project before your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film -- you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know that I have an awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you are aware.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we get to produce the results that we received to produce without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective for nature.
<unk> for nature, is subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
psychology is studying rational behavior -- neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
And I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is responding to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what they do with what they do.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy trouble with consciousness.
Well, does not address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how they operate <unk> how they work, how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, all are questions about how objective works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we kind of talk about, how we talk about, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, it's the question of why everything is that all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't still have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> scientist.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful source chain, and we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains chemistry, biology explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think this is a kind of <unk> right now -- something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, and I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the brain behaviors -- and so he studies all that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is risky.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that are <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Rather, they look fundamental -- and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, <unk> laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electric burden as a fundamental concept that those laws have changed.
I think that's the situation that we find out of consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- fundamental ideas, time, mass, then a matter of logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, of course.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness that govern the laws that govern the law that connect the consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the <unk> <unk> processes.
And physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But thinking of thinking is, perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling, <unk> some primitive <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little nuts for you.
How could someone think something so crazy?
And it comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's a difference, as space, and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just as others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of finding the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human being, complex.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with empirical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration -- which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And that <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a different degree of information integration of information, as significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the theory of <unk> there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high grade <unk>
Another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
You know, the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies below.
As Stephen Hawking's explains "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not being out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
So if this is right, they have a fairly serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness of the planet, the planet.
You have your own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, and at this moment, we have a collective collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole host of TED <unk> different from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least this is a question that you must have seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer at the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is the second thing that is universal.
<unk> a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think eventually we will find it to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village to Victoria.
He had a very normal, <unk> profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, my younger sisters with my sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a evident.
She actually didn't get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the middle class, so only after about 20 minutes in the middle class, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when is your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> room.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people like <unk> objects.
And we don't know it. And it's not a boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you probably are waiting for them to tell you, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not something bad and you can't make it <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing a pencil held by her mouth.
You may have seen a child running through carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the porn porn term -- because it would give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the representatives of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, by very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that individual.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange -- to say that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, <unk> people with disability on people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
We had some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was <unk> by so-called social model of the disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very upset with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your ability to be the best of your ability to do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to do it in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of a lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us very remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by anyone else.
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load your cell phone battery into the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have been sold to the disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us a hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a <unk> stretch has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not show the subtitles.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a girl was 15 years old, sitting in his bedroom -- watching the <unk> <unk> you don't considered <unk> of nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability to be <unk> by reaching up the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in the middle of Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think is to know what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so you don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, it's what I wear <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what's running through the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pounds of 110 pounds, trying to do it with all their being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine rising up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
<unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You'll have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be your favorite players, and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get <unk> how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, by this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What would be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he run and make a <unk> What will the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network? Or I would be able to make a <unk> in <unk>
What will you be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when we reviewed them, the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So here is a quick sketch on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> got a <unk> to his field <unk> to play it faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Others decided <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, and it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
You have to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want them because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose their <unk> and they hate losing games.
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner corner -- having a view of the people that are below.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have information <unk>
This is <unk> to good equipment.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being <unk>
It's also to be <unk> Who <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
They took the ball and <unk>
They went to a open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> Usually not the <unk> but the <unk> system <unk>
<unk> the protection area.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's a open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in their bombsight an area of grass that lights and it can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public public, and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and circus, like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings to show someone how it is, literally, be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much does this technology is worth of a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science instead of sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face is like us.
Thank you.
I recently took me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was the country <unk> the southern tip of the <unk> County -- that includes the <unk> <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who would build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from their openness, more of 1,600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take this bridge to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> like that, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every single four to five seconds, the body bumps against the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that not, normally they were going to be <unk> in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the people who are going to have this suicide approach, you will realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to get before you get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as a young man talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, official officials and psychologists train the new government today.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 <unk> last year, when I got a call from a possible subject by the suicide sentence sitting on the middle.
<unk> and when I got there, I saw Jason talking to a <unk> officer.
Jason had only 32 years and they had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, they had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
And after about an hour talking to us, he asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of clever and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been asked by it.
<unk> suicide damage affect a lot of people.
So I ask them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone or someone was <unk>
What do you do?"
What about that?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or you say to the person you know how it feels like it, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking for the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end up your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
And I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you his letter.
She lost his son in January January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and I blessing that they were <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home from that to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and the <unk> as disappeared as the night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong with without having a real disease.
It should not be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March March of 2005, 2005, I wrote a radio call by a possible subject, by the flying bridge near the north.
<unk> my leg on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, it immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to go back on that lane back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin became a <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and gave the hope and the life of another <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
I stopped talking about and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord Mr. <unk> No erase the events of the 11 March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin remains with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
I was <unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General hospital in San Francisco that night, you would be <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, give me the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide would not think of hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Normally this is just about three things: to sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Those incidents I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And during that time, I got my hand at three times.
On the end hand, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and living and they can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one of the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be willing to be able to be done.
<unk> can prevent.
Is there help. Is there hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you get into that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone at all.
When I became a model I felt that I had had the dream that had had since a child.
My outside was finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to go over later, when I look at this photo, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all broke our families, our religion, our religion, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who are always challenging the status <unk> which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent would even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I stood up as <unk> when I was born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why would you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to fix it.
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex, <unk>
Because of my success, I'm never going to tell you to share my story, not because I thought it's going to be a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to be a <unk>
Every day I appreciate being woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who take me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the African culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something like me: This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you done in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in a bathroom I won in a <unk> I won a <unk> and was a third <unk> of more than 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was from Queen of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when we were <unk> to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I was passed on the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you join the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She was also shocked to me when I stood in Thailand at the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries sophisticated and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to get surgery before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20 of November we make a global waking global <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who were <unk> and he stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living in living alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there was no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- first to thank all of my <unk>
To my support network, in my parents, which is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women <unk> who have been <unk> and some times, when they called me and they told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Some times work, others don't. It's just identity of gender, that's what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table, the subject that sometimes that task would not block and should have a space that would allow people to do, and this is a conversation we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of vulnerable and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> National Prize <unk> was made very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in today's societies, right from the beginning, when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcoming or his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes back to their <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot of a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, they <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when you put her third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only had the mother suffering, but the <unk> daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and the school flew in the school walk to her siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it gets 13 years old, he gets to be involved in his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his brothers and her family, and if you put the code of that of that case, honor, it might even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> but it also affects the lives of male male members in the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more standard standard of societies that are called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the best.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and embracing the decisions of their father and their mother and people's decisions even if they don't.
If you put it up with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for their children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and grabbed my pen, and I wrote a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came up with it when she was four and a half and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in many countries, but in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in our tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and your name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when you get the form of tourist -- Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason it was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document any document.
That's why the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
They encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school to girls and kids.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all of the economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls are forced to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers got killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a journal, for the blog blog -- was offered her himself for the New York Times, and I talked about each platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and <unk> in October 2012, he was shot by <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I told you to hear my wife <unk> <unk> <unk> by what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the way, for the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't get <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when he didn't just work.
It fights with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm a engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I have joined the Google <unk> group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I come to Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you beat a brain surgery.
Are you being like smart or not?
It won't be like that, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important <unk> and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemical -- because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about <unk> and mix it out of chemicals, and try to get them to follow alive.
More than I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul for what I decided to be able to try to get the dose of it, because it really doesn't have a clear map that tells you about it.
I started testing with <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dose would change my sense -- my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with each other.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was amazed by looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of the past.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that he wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, it was a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem that was in front of it, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do -- since then I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do that was going to <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after disease, and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of key reference to how to make those kinds of mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there is the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director could be able to use his imagination just to run the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used an MRI technology, an functional functional resonance to represent the brain, you can see the brain scanning that was done by <unk> <unk> and his fellow <unk>
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle of the medium shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual while you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were tracking their brains to create a great set of reactions in the brain of the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using just the scanning brain information, to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right side, you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're right about doing this.
We only need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, it creates the brain the same <unk>
This led to the search systems of the largest resolution systems that are available today, and their resolution became a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we achieve that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give me that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even I was able to do it with the recent test, first we have to ask the following, this technology is going to be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only provide small improvements in resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of magnets larger, let's make better numbers.
We can create much more complex structures with arrangements and slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to do really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever breakthroughs and bright and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> of radio radio frequency in the MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field the individual magnetic patterns -- structured magnetic patterns, <unk> radio frequencies.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio frequency patterns, we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid <unk> but the hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even even neural activity in direct neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct media to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more options than opening up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about getting out of the closet, and not just the gay self.
I think we all have <unk>
Her brother may be probably telling some person for the first time that your love or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to do with life in life.
All of us is a tough conversation -- and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits -- to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> that by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I had <unk> my head <unk> I was usually asked to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear to be uncomfortable at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my cafe with one of my <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> out inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised my next time I would say something.
It should be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time I was ready to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes in Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I got a breath down, and I went down my backs and my backs -- a little girl in four years with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist, feminist, a little girl with a question: Are you guys or <unk>
And so I got a deep back, again, I put it down on the way around, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw her clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a <unk> pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that's it. Just <unk> you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And because of <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some parameter in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
So I would give you a hundred reasons why I'm going to get out of my age, it was harder than coming out of it, but this is the <unk> The hard is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared him in a broken bank is harder than saying that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five-year-old five year-old son.
There's no more difficult, it's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with respect to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closets and we need to only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least any security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are, a closet is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
And I, who had a horse tail, a dress.
It wasn't the militant lesbian for fighting any child in four years that would fit the coffee.
I was frozen by fear <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole strangers I've spent my entire life in trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> and I walked around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women were <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay narrative had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your TV <unk>
Our program would be Will Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to desperately show her support, to make me know that I was out of my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where you felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find it, and realizing that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask somebody, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the real <unk>
That's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask any of anyone who has been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the armor. Be yourself.
That girl in coffee was not <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be able to know that they also have <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If you say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Just ask the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can go out safe <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very close to themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story about how intelligence, a productive example has been called the famous <unk> quote that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this thing as a criticism of the pioneers of computing as Alan Turing ...
And so some years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a physical race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a funny race that you don't know anything about this, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that explained how to a moment at the time, the asteroids that we put on the surface of a <unk> planet.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we will bring the diversity of possible future diversity.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the robots of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for a number of years: There is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is an claim that intelligence is an <unk> F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so, having in mind this equation, is natural <unk> What can you do with this?
How much is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life they should have tendency to trend more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of the long-term entropy production of the long term, but it actually arises from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy production in any system where you find in it.
<unk> <unk> could happen multiple animal testing, to play game games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of them without any time being <unk>
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He simply decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to be applications for <unk> robotics and human technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away the opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the success that's all connected.
This is a network capacity to network also have applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering the success of the Panama Canal to extend the Panama Canal to extend its scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> it is widely applicable to health care, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, successfully increase the assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk risk will have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flows from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So back to the beginning of the use of the term of the term -- the <unk> <unk> there was always the concept that if we were smart machines -- there would be a <unk> <unk>
Machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that perhaps all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It is all the opposite, that the urge to take control of every possible future is a fundamental principle of the intelligence that general intelligence can actually actually arise from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And so I often ask me, how do you look for goals to get rid of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, it's this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even though over the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points out that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that we go.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In all together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, and they were <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of developing worlds -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest record.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for a few years now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist scientist scientist and <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the sector.
Now, as someone really interested in finding life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more planets like the Earth, more like the Earth, more like our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know more about our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that has shown this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> as the <unk> <unk> take samples of the atmosphere <unk> and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offering not just short flight flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, you remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the areas of the planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and more <unk> places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen flowing through our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry about this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets coming out with a big and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable on Earth.
So I like the exploration exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to include humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will have to tell you that the party is going to be more late in the <unk>
But the goals for climate exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They only find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and <unk> spaces of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment. The paradox of <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Fermi Fermi asked himself to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to make that development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization are going to save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to capture the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I had my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were at the dining table, where they had them <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all <unk>
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get in, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had one early flight to Europe in the next morning and <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that we don't even more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, it was right there.
I'm a <unk> a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate, <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place that we would have to say bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen to you, the probability of it is a complete catastrophe there.
So I started thinking about it, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me he had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be out wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with obvious.
In the house, we had a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish are located -- where the tribes live, where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that really evolved the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys -- reading and <unk>
So at home, you get a place for keys, a hook to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
So for your <unk> a particular crisper <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it -- your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with your cell phone a picture of your credit card license from drive, <unk> <unk> by mail themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps even more stressful situation than when you faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> to all decision-making in medical decisions, and in fact to take for financial decisions and social decisions, any decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and your cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart disease, heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most expensive drugs in the world today, even you're likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have to have surgery in any medical procedure before it will help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic <unk> it's <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood a lot of the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat the most widely <unk> which believes it is.
How many people have to take it before they help someone can help me?"
300.
This according to research on the research of the cynical researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I love numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, brain spill or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you should ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in the five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> things -- <unk> muscle pain, and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out of your drug to help you help the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying you must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value of the crash, but actually this necessary number to treat it is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men in the older men in the cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has helped to move.
And the side effects of that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before time the questions that you can argue that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you shut a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> in the face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, they don't react very quickly. You could get the lunch lunch so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thinking that we like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have been shown.
So we need to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be able to put systems into the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the gate of entry in the same time, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol for me.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there that you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be able to get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over time, they mixed with local signs, and I developed the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a world of sound, is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
<unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise from eating from the bag of potato chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we don't <unk> the covered in the <unk>
All of this is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my art <unk>
I'm going to get more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't just experience through your ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> of social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could be <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in school, and the institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value -- something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capturing and expressing completely on paper.
And the same can be true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is <unk> in many different <unk> <unk>
If it's mapping a different <unk> for each finger as the piano expression, the <unk> movement -- the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so while the piano, English is a linear language -- as if it's <unk> only one key at time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 toes to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is happening with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and <unk> it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and gets it.
This is all day."
If you will, and it <unk> the speed -- visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel like the same can be said <unk>
All tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is two hands, the present is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite -- with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand right -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like chest -- something like <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show is this one. Please do do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three three signs are very similar. Everyone happens in your head and the chest. But they transmit very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have a social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you need to hear music to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to get you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you get everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good for cleaning other people.
The country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't have it <unk>
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too expensive, and it's also very risky to use those enormous ones.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our little <unk> classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you, kids who make electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is trying to take the best ideas from every child and try to figure it out in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> kids get a lot to get a lot of with the robots.
And then we set up what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turned out light and web cameras <unk> and <unk> it in a floating robot that gets slowly moving through the water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the image of the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board and process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get a rough estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step at a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would find it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I was looking at my own problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news news, they look at the Internet, and they were <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands of <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that takes a drink is the water in which you get rid of the water where the water is coming in.
You can also see the water is brown and the oil and the oil are also in brown color and when they're all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can lead to all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more distance, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also close to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power station close to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and the majority, at the moment, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and <unk> independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> parents don't <unk>
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of your life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> introduced us to make real-time data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust will spread from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil <unk> the nearest power power to date.
We get closer to a mile from the nuclear station, and with the fishing aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a little bit of sediment that we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple code.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong -- we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space and the environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, a little bit of biology, of optical color, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard wheels in new <unk>
The plastic, oil and <unk> are terrible <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel parts, the one of a spider silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is put on the environment, the other I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information that was required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> from different parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act mostly like filter, the other mostly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that runs gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- and that represents a <unk> personality of every designer and an architect to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, and this is kind of shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, from the assembly of the assembly and getting up to the growth.
You probably ask why now?
Why couldn't this be 10 or even five years?
We live at a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through a large scale of 24 feet -- like this robotic arm with a <unk> basis, that someday not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk> that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where each <unk> is a single size to shape the form of light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion <unk> from Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing collaborator <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> without seams between the cells. I'm going to show you more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments allows to design products that are <unk> not only the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, as comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface <unk> becomes <unk>
You know, this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like nature, varies not through addition to addition to the addition of other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> material.
But it's the nature of nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious person, but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and actually define a lot of what matters to me.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there was no difference between trunk, and they would have all a difference between trunk, and they're <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the Earth was growing trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What's the design if the objects were made out of a <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> in the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could <unk> your <unk> we could generate structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We were asking a lot of seed husks the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to get a wide range of <unk> from dark and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the robot can vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material that has made up by a little bit of 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, it leaves them dry to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first time on the planet makes a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even windows.
A <unk> <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of seed husks in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects that are designed to <unk> them in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain the life for the <unk>
To do that, we have to master the bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology, like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you have two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces the useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution per design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help that flow these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material on the material material.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, you get more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our little <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are larger creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that have <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the vascular tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is actually 3D <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts of a structure, the other is the glue or the <unk> <unk> these fibers each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first becomes the environment, it creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
So in order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a worm of silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk <unk>
And yet, when you put the silk worm into a flat surface, not within a box, we realized that it was <unk> a flat, <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've found that the shape of the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often get <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we design these <unk> we can shape silk <unk> without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we ran this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put us in our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to more dark areas, and that's why we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and the heat -- and it triggers the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked them to make silk worms to a silk farm away.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they got eggs, and the life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
<unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> you give all this pavilion and your integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a two materials of two materials -- designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time to this?
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and art and art came up with websites, and I was able to play the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, there must be a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, gets to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was struck by another thing, which was totally different, and I was amazed at it, and I get to absorb and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give you it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This is a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much more anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me was not <unk> at all.
I was concerned having to be afraid of commitment, or whether to be linked or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where they learned it, they learned about culture.
We ask ourselves first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what they would sing to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
So this question takes us over and over again as many different ways, <unk> <unk> students are asked to be asked to pick up the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens from being the cute exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they could be.
In fact, it does just the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer to 20 different things, even though adult adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to be involved in their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up your curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide in three parts: <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance era, the ideal was who I was very good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara Barbara refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned talking about with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization data and design and design, to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this whole idea for its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second superpower superpower is <unk> learning.
When we did, we are interested in something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to every new area that we are going on, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> in complete time, and a independent writer independent.
As a little pianist had an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it turned into a <unk> <unk> it was a lot of financial organizations.
It had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write a compelling step for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to get to what you're going to tell you, even if we were going to get it.
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is the adaptability. It is the adaptability. It is the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other designer pages -- sometimes a website, sometimes consultant to Kickstarter, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles -- depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Company Company defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the market needs, the ones that really do it.
<unk> from ideas, quick learning -- three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers in order to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in depth and put ideas in practice, and <unk> provides a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are dealing with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, <unk> largely are encouraging them to just be more like their <unk> <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart of heart, then, <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you could have been living today, we couldn't give it to her more aid than the one that he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from infections, many treatments for cancer -- for <unk> <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of whether Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their own years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spending on Alzheimer's disease.
And today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's research in the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everyone -- Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of us, even scientists, the scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy human brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's <unk> life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these <unk> dots go inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are <unk> they stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a wire could nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that goes on, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in the most part, have been reduced the cables and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> -- physical chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they're moving normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that they stick with each other within them, as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, so we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, this is you.
We need to make Alzheimer's that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we did, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have gained more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to test it myself a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers were <unk> to get 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are getting more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do, or it was, I know very sincere this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, one detail really called me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we got up and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent him to the chronic column -- you know, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's August, so I guess some of you probably ask, do they keep together <unk>
And the reason I think is why this is because I have been asked this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I had the paper was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that had a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as a result, I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday at night, and then Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called me <unk> Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was like, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with each other's experiences, but another thing is to find out that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write -- what they did every day for weeks -- always, they asked the same question: still they are together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase: <unk> you keep <unk>
A number of messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman yelled up to the stage, "Hey <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> which included the experiences of readers when I test the study on them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge for all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> research interviews, and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all, <unk>
And I understand that people don't want to know only if the study didn't want to know only if the study was able to know if they really were able to produce a <unk> or not just an adventure, but a real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer it.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, especially that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know whether to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, looking for interpersonal students, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants had felt closer after doing that, several more studies -- also used by <unk> protocol <unk> as a rapid way to create confidence and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community. And they've used it among people of the political ideology of <unk>
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never published published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little college college university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> I tried the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "Well, they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking at when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29 -- and I was going through a really hard separation to me.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, which was not pretty much my adult life, and he was my first real love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went through science.
And I was all able to find everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just research for the book to write but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought if I built myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than we will <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand me.
What I'm looking for from love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that will continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this promise that people were wondering when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a short cut for <unk>
There may be a way to be able to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very compelling story because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that says, still are together?
And his content with an answer, or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that let's ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't it?
How would you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how you live in the <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the brief version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year -- and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the ability to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had no thought everything I was supposed to call it.
I didn't think of how many times we would have two to make that decision, and how much times will I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he's always going to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and they responded 36 questions, having chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we're going to do, and what maybe I spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised for a few <unk> and in a way, I became like a <unk> of the forest.
New York City is a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humanoid or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going from a field trip and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to what Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more <unk> on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened. In some ways it seemed to be the opposite of size, as if it was that I get the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, frogs, weird bottles that I would find out the street, all I could find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow out -- drawing just like a <unk> of a <unk>
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from specimens to <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, <unk> of <unk> of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk> me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, then on a window, and then another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you <unk>
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's got double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh <unk> where it was <unk>
This is where the creatures with the heads of animals are run by the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
And anyway, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological thing that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak.
It also has a <unk> <unk> a long tail of snake that joins the <unk>
But anyway, their tail is on fire as a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> balloon made from Harvard terrorists.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if you were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is an archive of our culture, through media and material and materials are <unk> dictionaries.
But each acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting up for years.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a single human inside its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest can be <unk>
I'm going to meet you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and that you cover your penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There's a few pills that go out and come into the head of this strange statue in the head.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a <unk> a musician, a <unk> a writer, a <unk> a <unk> -- a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in the inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't begin to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
And I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will actually make it in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the counts of stem cells.
But they are also known for their <unk> side effects in their mind, because in the time that it takes to get to the <unk> <unk> it gets <unk> and worse even over the time that it takes to get to your destination, which is where it's more important, in the HIV supply.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily enter the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular drugs with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem with HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life <unk> by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly at the waste of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in terms of wounds to care with wounds and surgery surgery can be used for anything <unk> including drug transport <unk>
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes that open and <unk> almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to bring drugs.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit and powerful beam of laser on the infected cell membrane -- whereas these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug to be absorbed in the matter of <unk>
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or in <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> in the site.
The second head, which is a camera, it runs to the site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it frees it directly into the infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups like terrorists, and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do, when they're not shooting away.
My goal is to understand better to these governance agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent participation.
I do work in the field, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solve almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors don't.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements in 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> even we should be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't know.
The armed fight and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian Palestinian was known by their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the melting of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking too.
We had a complex <unk> communication machine, radio channels, online Internet websites and strategy in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising but by using business <unk> for example, <unk> companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their <unk> to make better and build their <unk>
The armed groups also do something else else -- create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put hospitals, they put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population to give something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghan Afghan Afghanistan or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups for safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> price for the population.
But in general, providing social media means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory in 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these are these organizations, we can be <unk> as something opposite of a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all their function, collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrids and the weak they are the states, like in the Middle East the <unk> and they fill that gap and fill that gap up the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that governance gap has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and create peace.
If we understood better groups -- we'll better understand what incentives will offer to foster the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not <unk> military power to win some <unk> but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safety of security, to fill that whole of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> tag would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but quite bad.
And therefore I became a bad feminist thing.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had some strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and hate sex. Like if that was bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a <unk> word.
I was fascinated by a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's just like a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, a feminist, and also, I was proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would get the same money for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or <unk>
We have the right to use very easy and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for controls <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We need to have the differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap music on volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and I'm curious, so the classic <unk> <unk> from the Yin yang of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical taste,
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I want to do, <unk> --  -- all of the homework tasks, but they also kill insects, the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of <unk> fairy stories.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, is her choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I keep that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay workers, <unk> and <unk> for white, white, <unk> and high school <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist indeed.
It also happens this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be good at perfection.
When we were <unk> we take them very happy from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already think of that <unk> before I try to get there.
<unk> women, especially innovative and the <unk> leaders are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> for fear that it means that it would mean that it was so afraid of not to be able to fulfill the little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist company.
In the <unk> Music <unk> from 2014, in front of the word <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a show <unk> to see this star star embrace openly Feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started <unk> whether it was a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the <unk> criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, an feminism more inclusive is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We moved to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide a limitless.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has your music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worst choice.
But when the bad decisions are justify that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two girls and <unk> and shiny and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
Where they were told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sports -- <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema elsewhere when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in your project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or their organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to be included until more as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions get to the top, people in the power of directors and music and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also claim with the courage of feminism, -- bad, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist is not going to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, especially because the ancient my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
And then my voice, and after everything I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I'm going to focus on a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little courageous, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I put the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need a lot more of it.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had lunch for him to visit <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that measles that can be fatal to a child with an immune system <unk> is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak <unk> had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines, disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud for the British Medical Medical Center.
I don't believe most of the smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she believed to be developing all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates are coming up so only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> are referred to routinely autism as an epidemic, as if I could be able to get another kid in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center of Disease Control from Atlanta -- what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "A <unk> detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of his son of two years, your visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is about the slow and slow progress of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> of Johns Hopkins <unk> <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> perfectly private, private worlds to the people of their own parents.
They could fun during hours by waving their hands on their faces, but they were <unk> from <unk> because when you don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By 1950, as the leading authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as far as <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he became a <unk> that he had turned to nine of every 10 children sent out by other doctors to be autistic and not giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a kind of child as a child as a child as a child and <unk> parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully in a refrigerator that we don't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that are together in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the age of two <unk>
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the children were simply telling them what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific psychologist from London, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband and her husband were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl with no support, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Foreign Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should be 30 years before.
<unk> a study of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some children could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, of dinosaurs or <unk>
On the other way, these kids were not <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody have realized these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then it was <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger's who led a integrated clinic with a school clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children teaching children were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and children followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he took to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And basically, Asperger's -- autism as a diverse continuous continuum that <unk> an amazing variety of gifts, and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> in <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American <unk> Association, to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad range of Asperger <unk>
These changes didn't go through the broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the performance <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first health clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
It no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> effect, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that he was, how people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the <unk> for the <unk> and a simple, powerful history and <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart center is that one of the 68 children in America are in the spectrum is right -- the people are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with it it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the standard standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk>
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding teachers, employers who are with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we went into a uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot allow us to lose a brain.
Thank you.

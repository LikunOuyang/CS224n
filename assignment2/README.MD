# Assignment Two # Word2vec

In this part you will implement the word2vec model and train your own word vectors with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Before you begin, ﬁrst run the following commands within the assignment directory in order to create the appropriate conda virtual environment. This guarantees that you have all the necessary packages to complete the assignment. Also note that you probably want to ﬁnish the previous math section before writing the code since you will be asked to implement the math functions in Python. You want to implement and test the following subsections in order since they are accumulative.

conda env create -f env.yml conda activate a2

Once you are done with the assignment you can deactivate this environment by running:

conda deactivate

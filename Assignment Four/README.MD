CS224n: Assignment #4

This assignment is split into two sections: Neural Machine Translation with RNNs and Analyzing NMT Systems. 

The ﬁrst is primarily coding and implementation focused, whereas the second entirely consists of written, analysis questions. 
If you get stuck on the ﬁrst section, you can always work on the second as the two sections are independent of each other. 
Note that the NMT system is more complicated than the neural networks we have previously constructed within this class and takes about 4 hours to train on a GPU. 
Thus, we strongly recommend you get started early with this assignment. 
Finally, the notation and implementation of the NMT system is a bit tricky, so if you ever get stuck along the way, please come to Oﬃce Hours so that the TAs can support you.

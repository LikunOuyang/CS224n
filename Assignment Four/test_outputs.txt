You know that what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with your leather <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that one epiphany is usually something that fell into one place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went to her for her every week in the bathroom <unk> until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when she was allowed to go into the bathroom room.
He did it in secret.
three years old.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the <unk> years -- I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults are never getting to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to get sick with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the take care of his family, because it was necessary, because necessary, need.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a ashes box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, and it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around my water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> of snow in another <unk> of snow year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and hold up to the end, while others can't be able to get more and <unk> in a passion for <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and by us, as well as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a little bit, I am breathing up your atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts, it releases water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up with me to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way of life cycle.
Part of the ice from the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are an iceberg I photographed at the Greenland.
It's unusual to get to see a <unk> iceberg going to be able to witness an <unk>
Here you are.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an average <unk> iceberg iceberg here.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one -- a baby Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about conception in yeah, they're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome -- and the sperm comes up to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is binds to the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
In my activity of the ground to be <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> of training, and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> the anatomy -- which is to say, human bodies and <unk> how have they considered body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins -- two people within one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical typology don't fit into corporate male and conventional <unk>
And in general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the <unk> or a <unk>
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks a receivers of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but not feedback.
As a consequence, the body develops following a course typically <unk>
When I <unk> the baby is a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And so often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing and they don't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called areolar glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
The majority of women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who does not know its <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman most women as I are <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example ago, a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he was raised and sex with her, I was wearing a life as a boy and I had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th chromosomes and the uterus glands were so active that they were essentially creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> no one at all.
And it was at age 19, when he began to have medical medical issues, caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, she was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with bacterial chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue, wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know exactly why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgeries is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we get to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is mainly based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity is to be black, he means to have African anatomy in <unk> terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture to <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children who are born like two people within one body.
The top recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What do we test to determine whether to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that we don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, more we need to admit that these categories -- that we were thinking were categories of <unk> stable categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we believe in science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in the public, but it is in the <unk> about when someone is dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of if someone was dead.
As a lot of him got a pen in front of the nose and if they were still not going to do it.
If I stopped moving it up.
But we can now say, for example, extract life organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma to determine the death of somebody. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about me.
It was <unk> from a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of evil <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave. and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find myself every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
The parents -- <unk> -- for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I tell you why.
What they were going to do, was a concept of <unk> and they did it with another thing that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our fathers <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power came into the right of the blood of blood passed off the grandfather, to father and then the son, etc.
The parents would have rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were actually <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- science <unk>
And it stays very clear, if we look at the story of the fathers -- <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations -- and therefore they <unk> the concept of power <unk> by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were passing into the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundation of the future of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
And then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement, and saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in the color that <unk> the <unk> coincidence about the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> in front of anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years were needed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should hold it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why it makes sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary. was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: was born March March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to your sexual consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for everything that doesn't have a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you, if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary. It doesn't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science was going back so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point to have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do it.
But a lot of people have been stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome -- and that to marry a woman has to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests <unk>
But this is also very strange because the story that I told you to the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should be judge people, not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure I'm not sure that we need to be involved in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans who I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can take more intelligent <unk> intelligent people's relationships than 40 people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to allow the United States to think about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men are susceptible to being killed -- unless they are willing to meet a change of sex in which case it is allowed to live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins and then pick them apart, and so they <unk>
But when the phone asked him the case of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation that came to me that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he has considered the political kid instead of the separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up with that, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be, or as it might have given more participation.
And I want to say something a little radical for a pandemic, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in finding the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my stories I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was feeling like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> and so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, the more I think there's something like the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the adult and the male that makes us more resistant to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very close to finding the way to protect people by the state, it is possible that they have more likely to be put into this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of support support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we define democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So while we tried to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family I think about where you want to go live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily reach the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just laid off by apartments.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in their apartments are already owners and the other half of us still will not be able to do that.
You might try to increase the ability to <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all these <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place to build a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that <unk> place to build <unk>
So I proposed that governments would bring up new reform areas to contain large cities, and I gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come from his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> I went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following election <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we have <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, "You know, <unk> the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> which, in some cases, worth thousand dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in a very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that supports the rules that are going on, and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> to me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> world.
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice in a city that you could go to that could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to North America.
And they also add new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from countries <unk> they could benefit from the countries that are helping them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so they could all be able to trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a few thousand square miles.
And shortly after the January of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting on Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed in the other voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the 24 of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center in the city that is building in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second town.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the managers to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the court of the last sentence for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and developers who are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that would like to grow in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to go and get a job -- sometimes they are <unk> mothers who have to make money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen, in some decade.
So what does it look like in building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is in it, I'm going to make a <unk> a public confession to the <unk>
I love to be wearing wearing her, and more recently, to photograph and post my blog and colorful and colorful <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores will allow me to reduce my <unk> impact on the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money is going to be a good <unk> I think it's <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's about my size?
I'm going to like color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what about someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I was going on.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
We will be inside for a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else I wanted to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know about the woman who walks for TED in inner underwear,  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not using new clothing.
Let's start with my Sunday.
This is called a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to do well.
You can almost always see it great for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> made me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've used in week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a little bit of you."
<unk> <unk> of the child who's wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe that you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't have to look at it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again, when people came up to me this week just by what I was using. And we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, and I'll give you everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things back.
I don't need <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there's always going to be another crazy suit -- <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart, and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left side -- which is the logic -- and the right side is the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these extreme ones, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be obvious and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have a intuition that you can have developed over the age of the years is that one thing says that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always was <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in the parking lot taught a valuable precious lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics.
At that point I was the physics of a few years, you needed the mechanics of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my part of my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we make a very good close-up of the small <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a shape, and that stands up on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and started all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a way of swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of rare things, but then when other people go up to make those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, I want to get them.
Quantum mechanics says that the inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The classmates from the inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to put all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We took the lights, then we would take a <unk> and pulled out the whole air, and then you bring it into a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when you give it a smooth <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that is only happening with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing you can do and do not take at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in particular <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one can only take you in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we went back, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was left there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are simply embedded in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head and my boss allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so.
A lot of negotiations and stories are going on with 17 very interesting museums are nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire for more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> the <unk> -- the <unk> Van <unk>
Actually, I'm going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, or <unk> or <unk> it doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and then with one click, we jumped inside.
They are inside, that you want to go at the end of the hallway, right?
So go forward. It <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> signal.
If the museum shows the picture, you click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixel markets.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixel markets.
It can zoom in around very simple.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
I was talking about a little bit, I talked to some people, and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is going to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a bit of perspective, I'm going to pull away the image, so you'll see what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite night.
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It takes it up, and it really takes it to it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this frame, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can basically create your own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just made a place around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all the incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even not come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means does justice to your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> an <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened to be something very interesting about the year of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So sometime ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, it was <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting today is that control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered on networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As soon as you can say that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for weekends, at <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's as if almost all of the existing atoms were going back and <unk>
And that is changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end took the hammer and he got it up to the Moses -- you can still see a little dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and drive something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup there.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the day, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline, is at the top.
At the late early people there are people around here and doing called <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a call called the bathroom.
Second time. End of time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night they were all <unk> to the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister of then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the age of <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get it.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their change in the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, and we put a little chip, and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same as much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on things complicated and there's so much <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped is not that it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day still is still there.
If we showed that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change.
That was the reason for this project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we heard at the beginning, which is driving over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces, in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a studio, it was imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> which is opening and <unk>
It felt like a water <unk> with pixels of water.
If you get the pixels in the pixels in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain is opening up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot of it.
And they had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you get up to it is open so that you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to try and do the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let me happen, but a building that kept making slices and holes in the water and you had to jump out for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give people our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and that every single pixel in the air is going to change color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before it moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud, you could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and size, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a <unk> cloud in 3D that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them being controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D in real time as a movement.
It can get all the movement.
You can travel all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our environment -- as a oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of power self-organizing from the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel in our cloud.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered in the pixel either.
You can move inside, and you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky like something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are these things?
Just imagine you would tell you that, with only about changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> for more accurate exact way and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be better at best, will be more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What are they going to do with you.
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose <unk>
Some more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about the <unk>
Ah, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great puzzle of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay entitled <unk> in biology makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this room, well at one end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees, about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 to 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its majority the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human recovery, but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the pancreatic <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the more bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm, shallow <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you can want to want to want to be <unk>
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients, <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like a single and only <unk> and a human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that each cell can be divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes to sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of the sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every single year I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door in hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him find a beautiful <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make us healthy <unk>
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and healthier.
Evolution is going to happen the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let me let us go to the sea.
I think we all had the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the bigger or stronger or faster and faster and even more smart.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that we would see if there were fish there, fish spread into a vacuum -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in the evolution, and in particular, if you look forward to the <unk> Phase I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the trick behind that would be that through medicine, in the first place, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we were very much <unk> that no longer is possible to have the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that you make a traditional kind of evolution, which is imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the species <unk> distant planets are going to exist.
But there is a third possibility, an attractive and intriguing and terrifying possibility.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not just the sex in its <unk> but in its own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three base pairs of the human genome at a low cost to the 20,000 and a week.
It's not a long way to make the human genome for <unk> and will be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more <unk>
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine against <unk> <unk> cells.
Can you imagine something nice to come out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, remove the diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same engine in the science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could go to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that you could normally take 100,000 years old, and we can bring them to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's choose the different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions.
For good or for bad, and before these choices might depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to you with the flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would take the airplane to the Hudson River.
It's usually not the road.
Let's take the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then three words said ...
The first three words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes at a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'll open it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the George Washington bridge -- which was not a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry that the time I <unk> in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental watch goes down, <unk> 14, 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break down in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, it's not scared.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
And at that point I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live differently.
You guys are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please don't be that -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What do you think that you are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to be <unk>
Thank you.
I have clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important ones in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company, and I have a design company, so that, obviously, graffiti is a <unk> <unk> we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that you see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to get a check and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how he was going to <unk>
I met with his brother and father there at that very moment, and "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to speak, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research that has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
You start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of safe insurance companies, and we got a machine so that I could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's more <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from it, and you say, "You don't know, this guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the corner of all the corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken the frames from the walls and then would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> walk in my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of cheap sun <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of the copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it up on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and you build it up, we published the code <unk> the software is <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no company that says, "No."
There is no hospital I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then more than a planning year -- two weeks of planning -- my intense video session at night, Tony was going to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and is looking through the support system of his life.
I took the bed to the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he turned back to the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I was at seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential is deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the <unk> 50 inventions and was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the middle of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
Nothing that there is in this room was possible -- the <unk> the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a time.
Do you do it <unk> anything in this room.
I am not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want we all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we have to do. If it's not now, I'm going to get it, and if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last couple of years in situations generally very difficult and at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It was hard in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating just a lot of fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in large part of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance, with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that we have <unk> attractive, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that would be <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to come up here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk from 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and as content could be treated in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago there was no <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prove it, nothing could be done for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that treating the <unk> of products, and the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> of marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest <unk> film.
What happens in "The largest <unk> film is that everything up at the bottom, at the end, it has brand images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> at the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> You know, <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just the <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the rush of marks X in the title, but we're going to make sure that we have all the categories that we could in the film.
You may be <unk> a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you have.
The most cool car you've driven in "The largest <unk> film ever <unk> the best drink, you have <unk> <unk> of "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, and making it <unk> <unk> will make you <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The film of the film was complete is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the film is beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to <unk> it will be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it is very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it certainly is worth convincing to convince a couple of big markings
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time to come out of the film we would look at us like a lot of <unk> phenomenal.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about it.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought I <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so this was, one for one, all of these companies just disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to count that new vehicle worthy of attention to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in practical practices.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to making it really changes something changes.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk>  like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but you want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he was looking like it was like, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There is your story, it's my story, and there's the actual story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away in the middle and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to suddenly see -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giants and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who do a little Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies have so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk> film.
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to help you with you."
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a solid, to <unk> to bar, as it is.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we have, we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people is the reason that we care about it.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: So my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: So the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray ones and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories of the sun, or I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In <unk> <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They put toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I would say <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to be Tom <unk> but I often miss myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed a expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could certainly do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people make a way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world where the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come up and start in a place and start in a place and start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and how to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what do you do that?
What's the <unk> What phase is you find right now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be frightened. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> Yeah. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy <unk>
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> -- the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They worked very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only going to be attached to one of their strong points or in the other instead of focus on both.
Many companies tend to -- and it's <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they are avoiding fear, those elements -- and you are actually supporting them <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS:  What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your identity of brand, your brand personality that would be?
You're a <unk> You're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more good at a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be very cool as the contemporary contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or audacious as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're a stable -- stable family -- safe, sacred, <unk> or wise -- as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
It allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as long as a movie of movies.
We went to San Paulo where the ads have been forbidden with the open.
Across the city for the last five years, there are no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are becoming a path in schools with problems of money in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I have ever interacted with is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> taken off to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They were success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January and since then, and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online.
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about is not being <unk>
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get the people that are pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss of risk is preparing the whole company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to stand to transparency.
More than never a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data on great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization -- the <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons, is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and regulate them, we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, box -- then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, box <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> and the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these boxes, so these systems of control.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we would <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So it was very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat who doesn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then of experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working in that place:
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than the aim for you.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> people who obviously had all the internal information.
Do you know all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this <unk> code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we were able to make sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to engage with the real world, with potential real world targets.
We need things about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about targets, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a native valuable, and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear nuclear power plant and the plant <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants of energy between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in a effort to <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
The rotor is that part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can afford it, and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better at it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
For no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> were going to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I actually saw me.
There's the gray, box and the top is the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the stock values of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes from speed, you have to open escape valves.
Obviously, this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have to be able to disseminate this burden with a key key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology.
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than let's start making it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main quality of this thing.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> prize.
There is a while, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you a <unk> skills, or one that makes users out of lawn chairs.
In <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets on in the morning, gives you a big force -- which also increases its speed, and help, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other subjective things.
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, it has to take on their back a 45 percent charge of 45 pounds, and it's <unk>
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of soldiers -- with chronic chronic chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can rotate by 90 pounds of land for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
You know, what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of lawn chairs about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in chairs of wheels, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that is often very young, with damage in the spinal column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We are also talking about the population that are <unk> rapidly.
Their only choice, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other laps, -- it's the wheels.
And this has been that over the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was about 19 years ago had an injury on the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer computer here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the motors to the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward to this very soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing costs <unk>
At a fraction of second, I lost all of feeling and all the <unk> movement down.
A few time later, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> never again.
That happened 19 years ago.
I stole my way to the last bit of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has enabled me to learn how to <unk> it costs to <unk> climb rocks and even ride in the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change our future to future generations -- not only soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of lawn chairs all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
<unk> are along with the chimpanzees, their closest closest kin.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
While chimpanzees are dominated by large guys, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where ethnic violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest, and it has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is an <unk> one of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the violent <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been <unk> and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunting trade trade and deforestation makes you not be able to fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the <unk> hidden trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
At <unk> as humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play isn't just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
With him learn to <unk> and learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo you see the roots of the laughter -- the same laughter, the dance and the human conference.
Play is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of only unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking at all.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case I love it, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much in bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that we would sometimes play themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But we will bring the ultimate game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For farming, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, it can be the moments that it's the most urgent thing.
So these <unk> primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as it <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, it was fires as a captain of captain in a body of fire <unk>
And in our city, where volunteer volunteers at a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But still, there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to Captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that I certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and save the dog's dog.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money, which, for the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live building just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go to the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and get this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the corridor I went to the fire firemen -- that at that height or less had ended up the fire and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house for the house yard where, as he was expected to expect, their treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house of home <unk> by the brave effort to save her house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling -- as voluntary Rome I'm witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who've achieved, or are in the <unk> remarkable success levels I'd like to remind you to remind you.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you're going to go back now.
We had food in a dining hall, <unk> a neighborhood park.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we're going to be able to affect somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first particular blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules modules from a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings, or bridges, a brick at the time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He called him a brick of <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings, or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block -- the favorite one in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> to a few other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked by magnets.
So you can't be placed in a wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the same, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and you can very quickly start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one in a green one is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
So let's take this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster, you just turn this button to this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection rise.
We want all the interactions in the world to become <unk> <unk> to use.
<unk> <unk> panels, <unk> <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given kids to do them to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light bulb works, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took a couple of weeks ago to the Rhode Island, and that they have no expertise in engineering, just in wood wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is afraid of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment to focus on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I would have been term time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk> to <unk>
I took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to Third World -- we sent them to the wild world.
They did great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> to <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is someone to do it, when you have caught by snow because he knows that it's not very good at turning fires up fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get to help for the way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I was doing a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that the citizens would do with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put him <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it does have a component of music?
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads in a viral way.
A responsible for systems of the city of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> but people would steal their batteries.
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to get people to get rid of it, when they were <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that will use to use it.
And this has spread out without <unk> and natural ways.
If you know a bit of government technology, you will know this isn't normally happening.
The software acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the California court of California that until the moment has cost 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral is a kind of warning post to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as a lot of work to work, not as a lot of people think they should be.
Nor is it as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without computers?
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't taken up with the government.
They feel a great frustration that they were not <unk> they were not <unk>
And these people know something we've lost in view.
And that is that if we stop the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that are given us insane, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because they alone didn't get it.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> is not <unk> the government itself.
And given that the government ultimately made us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it thought about it will affect the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the center of health care center.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So please Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It's got a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the cube of crap behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government of the government to collaboration, distributed <unk>
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it could have connected with government services to be necessary but your neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about governance is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are going to do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will turn our values and analyze our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because government is like a massive ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
So it's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which keeps that that belongs to that that we funded as something operating on us, that other thing, and in consequence are missing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed <unk> of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have gone into the government, it's time that we ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we get to where we have to go without changing the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government function so that can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, and I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express your opinions anywhere at the same time and do it.
So when the government problem are faced with no matter how much your voices.
They're using our hands.
They lay their hands to work to program applications that make better government work.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking away from <unk> they dumping a bucket of junk that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government to pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all of us are going to be a multitude of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, and in death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that are living in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> I've gotten a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words in a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard enough, it was power.
It was the last word everywhere in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born over the cinema and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard -- but it was also <unk>
When I was little, I looked at her, and I was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I felt so strong that I could barely breathe and then I was going to go.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> still feeling my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I got back to me again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish you would have to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to catch their time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and she was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, walked up the room, and he took me out of the hand and said, "Come on. The two will be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom and I said, "Yes, I was like, "Yeah, you know, <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want to do is you are always going to do the right thing -- even though the right thing is to do it.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, I was <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, I was like, "Yeah, you know, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South Africa, I have a brother older year and one sister a year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the usual time.
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, you <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good -- you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
He went up with the strength of strength and <unk> "Oh, not to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it is the power that he has about identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we need to be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there's 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One in three black black and 30 years is in prison or 30 percent of it is in prison, or on parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, UMBC, in 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to the <unk> of all young people in jail.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear politics and the anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at some of the work that we're looking at in our work with some pretty good developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you have a rights <unk> if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of male male people have lost the right to the <unk>
And if we put it over to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where the children were 13 to die in prison.
We have this country in this country for children, without a chance to come out.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
I would meet people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense of sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die by <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that it's innocent and released from the death row.
A innocent rate <unk> an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation it would not be allowed to be able to never be able to fly airplanes if in every nine that you would <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of the <unk>
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history -- I talk about slavery, <unk>
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know much about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a sharp time for terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, makes you <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history we want for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of racial racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time I would do with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany talking about death penalty Conference.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> We have no death penalty in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are <unk> and <unk> we were going to run the people."
So let's think about this.
How do we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their majority <unk>
We couldn't do it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things they are, but yet, <unk>
We love innovation.
We seem to be fascinated by technology. It makes creativity.
We love entertainment.
But <unk> those realities are affected by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate both together.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, greater engagement, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never be going to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, the development comes out of creativity.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the <unk> of the heart.
This connection to the heart is what drives us to look at not just how brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, counseling for spirit, an will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation, for the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think, who still in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to the technology and the design, that allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
So we go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young lawyer to meet <unk> <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called to me, <unk> comes the Mrs. <unk>
You want to come and get it.
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let me tell you that it's that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the transportation of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out of <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> got his finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been asking for simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than each of us is worse than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, isn't because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone gets something that doesn't <unk> you know, it's a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
This is not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not by the way they treat the rich and <unk> rich, but by the way they treat the poor, they <unk> them.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really deep themes about what we are.
And sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, they have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what's not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
And one night I was very late -- I was awake in my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, has to have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> that my 14-year-old black client is treated as a <unk> white, <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I had been able to conduct <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
To my horror, not only had been <unk> but he had been sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, I said, "Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped me from the car, walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man, <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
And so I approached them and I was surprised.
And I was interested in the ear, you heard it.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my own identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When the judge came in.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And I started going back again.
People started to get there.
I was the one that had written those <unk>
And they came the policemen with the tax <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all excited, because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I was able to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I looked through the window, and they would hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black man in the room came into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant. He was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood foot stood up, and he looked at me and he said, <unk> to this young man to tell this young man who kept his view in the target with <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't really be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is tied to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious wish of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make a effort to do -- the funds you spend today in policy politics.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes do not get nowhere.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds will be turned to the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decrease in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why it comes this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain -- to steal a bicycle by small crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited to be <unk> here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months of <unk> could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer to be negative news, because our minds will pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing more matters to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, early <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative ones.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us bad news for the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But it's probably not like that.
Maybe, in return, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the species species -- lack of water and <unk> without any doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at solving the problems and, in the long run, we just with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita adjusted by inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> television, mobile television, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have been dreamed of <unk>
So much of this is technology and <unk> its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had on the technology of information jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer for the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time -- in the war and in peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the made of fast computers that are used to build <unk>
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to Moore's Law from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> they call infinite computing and sensor and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, fuel and food, digital medicine.
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked in the newspapers the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to <unk>
This is not a easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for every cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach them these technologies at our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single person on the planet, it's about creating a life of it.
It's about taking that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington state is aluminum <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal metal again.
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It will be an analogy to the future.
Let's think about shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about it, but it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> rupees against 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have a abundance of energy, we also have a abundance of water.
Let's talk now about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl courts pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed on.
<unk> a very famous photo. How do you get <unk>
"A pale point <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought through the water <unk> but also there's a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> the size of a refrigerator size is small.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any single source of <unk> saltwater <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just been making a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which we will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation, for this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communication in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever happened.
Now better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video libraries -- images, libraries of books and music, technology of diagnostics are now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get into the health care in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation something called the X <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with which they speak, and because it has <unk> can be able to get blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a regular <unk>
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of our health care workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA or DNA virus that will not be <unk> call the <unk> and first of all, stop the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a developing world.
I call it the billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
So we just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What would <unk> What wishes to <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we have the largest economic injection of the story.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three million more members of human humanity, educated and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and being able to act for the first time?
So what did these three billion?
And if you're contributions we can't <unk>
One of the things I learned with the X Prize, is that small equipment guided by his passion with an obvious goal, they can do things -- things that before they could only make large corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up with a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this college professors -- among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went on and began to <unk>
And it's shown that today the recognition of human patterns is better to folding us proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we are going to get together to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very rough idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they still say they remain <unk>
So what about here?
The second story also illustrates another concept: <unk> of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The pond, I was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 percent, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was more about the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had halved.
I went to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was supposed to impose countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fishing in it, and we did studies in southern China in the southern Sea of China and above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we capture there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the sea fund.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny <unk> on some of the <unk> remains that are fish coral fish.
In short, the sea fund came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then starts commercial fishing <unk>
The background is going to be a solid coral, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Don't the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
I once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to do it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We have the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the start starting to start -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you take this something like this.
On the axis, and we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images to be at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the <unk>
And at the end of the end to keep the <unk>
And that, in great extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they are not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects the people when societies -- they kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk>
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great <unk>
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them would like to be Captain such as a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually they don't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in oppressive societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that it can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine zones, we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of, because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine marine area and they can benefit from the vision to <unk> which allows them to delete their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think there the arts and cinema can be filled with the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay. 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were touched by the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do we do with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is why do I do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made and what importance to it.
We all want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today the online video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
You can do anything famous on the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage is viral and he receives countless visits and <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three of the communities of participation and factor.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the popularity of last summer.
<unk> was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would give you a video to the popularity of the strong.
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are showing us new and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   You all want it to reach the weekend, the weekend.
<unk> from Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
And just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed like to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it off, and so many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a set of trends embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody of each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare to know that there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version to the old version.
And then it became international did.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all become part of.
Because today not only <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have been predicting <unk> <unk> or Steven or Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video video days -- just the really unique and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy on the <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't very interested in too much.
And so I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you avoiding properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> had been able to get five million watched and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth all how new we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of the story.
As I said earlier, one of the world's celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old means, they're just the ones of the current media -- but they will make the future of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by one unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, would be friends, you know.
It was <unk>
He died broken in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but I was doing it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do that.
And after a four year-old <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was so slid into the sea of <unk> ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirated rape and death.
As most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were excited first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the dying engine, and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants as well.
Unlike the middle-class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of <unk> English was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working on six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English.
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra mentoring in English.
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide holes in the other.
A uniform uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was building determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and me <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares would start to be able to do it.
She opened a store of computers, and then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and <unk> and kids were <unk> trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student -- relentless with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, increasingly, by violence abuse and <unk>
But a lot of them had help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was choosing the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't exist.
As a resident <unk> I was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk in sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> about the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get into the boat.
The "no" ever had been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you won't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I talked about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a <unk> race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a little bit in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, an optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I took a small group of people to who the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
They go back to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
And after one trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared like.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and bringing the cause, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have been <unk>
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, he died, <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask myself about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the <unk>
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave movement in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that don't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you, and you can see it, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth of <unk>
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and go to the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
In that time when I was <unk> the great blue warrior Indian, he had <unk> he had <unk> a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he would get water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of fun.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was telling me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow me to allow the magic and not <unk>
As my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and the cameras of luxury and cameras prevent you to go.
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I <unk> I dropped me to this technological world to see how to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device that can connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where do we are.
<unk> with the picture, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do with that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl are very excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always going to get me exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light up your way in the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy, in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I move into this magic device, within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there have always been maps but it's static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk> here.
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts who are <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, for millennia, in an old and wet book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a story that is about present issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not have gone into the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out on the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As I was a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children aren't doing it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual that we have to go out and in a chapter, and you put a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
And within the different variants of magic between magic and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction in which one comes out with the iPad and the video on and through <unk> reality is <unk> you see a group of cartoons that appear on the interior plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and you're going to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be linked with technology and magic and technology comes to each other.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and to that magic, joy and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop hearing patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University, was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she lifted a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we be <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not everyone, but most of the projects of <unk> are failing because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi progress.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge like you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get <unk> sent my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is on weight, not at the same time that I need care of <unk> or some urgency of that, but it would look back.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available in the week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take care of their homes, take their blood pressure, they take their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back and recover control and be captains of their own <unk> but also help us health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of health care costs -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
And they are very simple techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but they can also do with <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video video.
We all have navigation Remote on the <unk>
Maybe even we have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs in <unk>
Where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives at this time.
So what we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked them to the audience -- you see a <unk> please have a <unk> please make it open, where, when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and other are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> are already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell cell to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we wish we were <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so you help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on holiday and someone else can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us to verify these <unk>
It could be instant messaging or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please take you into this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera that was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process I would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: construction on a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like the dark and dark <unk> at the time but with the common goal of keeping the reality level.
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to capture an idea that you can capture a moment.
But what does it seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
Show the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a slippery surface.
It's actually not about if it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you an easy example.
Here we have three perfect objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in some ways you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain is not accepting the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the photographs.
It's really different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic -- I think they are those in which we don't even believe the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining pictures it's very important to be <unk> because otherwise something is going to look wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos -- <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images they meet with these <unk> were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect game.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that it would find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a spring of rock.
And yes, I even did the red house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think it's missing planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and a very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
So please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details, but the general way.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale.
I'll talk about technology with curves -- <unk> is something new.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
They get more intensity because they write about paper.
Why are we <unk> curves for <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I wanted to take you on the diagram would look like a ridiculous thing.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you were -- for example, some other technology, as transportation, in a curved curve, it would be very dumb, you'd see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of shipping technology would be as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of increasing growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
And they would take one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask is, and ask me, is: what is that new way that you adopt the world?
So what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember what the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all is so different than extrapolate what we're doing today has no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that you can be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back a few billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock <unk> with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around it.
If we look at those chemicals that we give you an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that point, I had floating on some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them had a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> it would be a separate distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> more chemicals and more chemicals and <unk> more.
Often I lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry, very simple, but things became interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> We can now write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have spread out of the room.
What was the next <unk>
The writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another one billion years.
But then another big step came in where things got very different -- very different and was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form information forming these cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, they were together in that, and established a <unk>
From that way <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful in all the individuals of that community, they were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to me so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are emerging communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't making more than processing information in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible structures to understand and transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time they ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built on these data processing structures that we would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures vastly accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communications trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here sitting emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we become sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now went through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> and presentation methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the video tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and capable of evolving more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced certain evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And we've now accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that would tell them took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next ones like electronics, it looks just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that I work for <unk> would not be possible without the advances in recent ways.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know it does every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the more extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those who are more likely to do what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say that I want to see numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to looking at numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of <unk> <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that make the <unk>
They put those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I'm going to make the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and that the children would have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
It took some mutations in it.
And it tries to bring it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or, in cases complex in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are making numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're very strange software.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I once went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> a plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, it doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
And so we started to depend on computers to make complex design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than it produces the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment of analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant for our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of whatever it comes from.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to let me give you some of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
He's going to go out there -- the <unk> talk about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we're talking about 300, from a <unk> that they <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that whatever you try to go to the first base, don't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three hundred <unk>
You know how to call a 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who's 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player in the Great League of <unk> in doing more 400 strokes at a regular <unk>
Now I'm going to do this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Just imagine you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family family is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know what?
She's getting this year better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let me ask you.
What do you think it should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I included, with the mandate to be perfect.
You never, ever made a mistake and tried to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a wise <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school, said that Brian Goldman was a <unk>
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> University of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
Out of my kind of anatomy, we <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> diagnosing differential differential -- frequent <unk>
And I even knew the basic diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were going to do everything, you would know everything, or more possible, close to everything, because I was afraid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lunch lady into the emergency service where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency E.R. I applied to a cardiologist to have been going to be going to that patient.
And reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I was <unk> I listened to a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, heart stop and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment of the treatment that I was looking for.
I gave him <unk> and medication to relieve the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent it to her house.
I actually made two more mistakes in it.
I sent it to his house without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone or I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, they would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home to her home, I didn't pay attention to my inside that I would say, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, he was so sure that until I asked the nurse that I was going to go to the Mrs. <unk> believe that he's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high and the ambulance together with the ambulance people took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I would stop to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. And I did something that I didn't do normally, I don't normally do?
I went through the emergency service of the road service.
And another nurse, not the one I was born from the Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the medical emergency.
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are remembers that?
It remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other other nurse with total <unk>
Well, she said, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
In an hour of having come to her house, after I gave her high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance were brought it to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure <unk> which means a severe shock.
I was just just breathing and blue was blue.
The emergency staff, all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was hoping against every hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was very obvious that they never had.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And to the ninth day, he left her to go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks later, I was struck by it and experienced for the first time the shame of shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt lonely, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch them with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame I talk about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was bad, but we're bad guys.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would go and make sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I send it to his house?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake that was so <unk>
Why do I chose <unk>
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day, <unk> opened up the sky and finally came out, and I was wondering if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if we were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for us to make more errors, would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it turned out.
Two years later, it was an hour in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed up here.
I looked into it as a little bit <unk>
She <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was running at the door, he kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my change <unk> my boss asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And he did the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the top, but it can cause the close side of the tracks.
He did not die.
You know, you know, you know, antibiotics by <unk> and <unk> in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I got <unk> and went back to work, until again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
I took an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out normal -- a colleague who was looking at the patient <unk> a certain sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, and I called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I was able to liquid her to <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
I checked it up and when I noticed some sensitivity at the bottom right-hand quadrant, I called a surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was excited about me.
But I would like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant have been over the last five years.
<unk> ashamed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you're going to hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust that I would have a hard time to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that they don't sleep and the ones that they have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes, will stay a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about spreading and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical litigation and doctors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Star <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day in which one in 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system that cumulative infections are more and more, causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die in this country, <unk> medical errors, by errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up <unk>
In both cases, it is about <unk> <unk> because we're not getting this problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is added up every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes to <unk> eyes and <unk> and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we removed all the professional professionals -- well, not to get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white, white art, it's a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah, <unk> -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to slow down, and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> I can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> is human -- they know human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a love and loving way for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, you make errors instead of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, I'm going to give errors errors ...
And I feel a lot, but I am effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk> day.
You know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently did a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that he says to pick a half an American American, are about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot of a lot of research followed for a week to a group of companies.
Researchers had the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we are going to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job there are lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the <unk> <unk> and how many of the <unk>
How did they include the way those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I would choose to do to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
And as I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and need to meet their answers.
When you ask a question, as I'm blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Again, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please take a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we take water from <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked me, why never bought nothing?
This is the shelf oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> who were coming from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
I put a place for <unk> right at the tent.
We put it out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had a 60 percent, that when there were only six, about 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when we were <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
From the time you stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the <unk> the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> you probably have a good deal to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the Earth <unk> is actually affecting us very well <unk>
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we look at decisions about savings for retirement about a million Americans, in between 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of operational funds in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program to help people save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the older people were the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, even in that case, there is a bad consequence.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people will be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we can make the decision, that <unk> even when this is going against self-interest itself.
It is more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things out -- even though objectively going to be better.
The main reason is that we will be looking at that broad array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations in order to compare that, to a contrast to the contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to do that today -- four simple techniques that we have in a way or another, in different research, so you can rehearse in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less more than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange choices, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, the cost, there'll be a better experience in the choice.
When I <unk> & <unk> I went out of 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> we eliminated the products for loss of cats that are less <unk> they increased <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and less costs.
You know that today's supermarkets are offering 45,000 products.
In a store of Walmart is offered about 100,000 products.
But the biggest store in the world is now <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices that David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to an immediate background of life.
Those of you really want to choose to choose to choose them, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Good. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually did hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, than in the second step, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images would make it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences should be in a very concrete way.
Why are people spending 15 percent more on average, when they use debit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look any real money.
It turns out that I got to see more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive than people are going to get worse.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> personnel, who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being trained to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting, <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would tell you the staff that you would think about the positive things that would be held in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> 20 and an increase in the amount that were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that at the retail <unk> across the <unk> of the magazines can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification shows me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you will take a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you will take a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But, you know what?
This classification framework is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something to you who are not going to be that <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
Who are I supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you only put it a little bit.
We need to increase environmental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a <unk> decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German <unk> manufacturer that allows you to <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, so you can put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each.
<unk> color of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order that the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at a few times four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> in 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to do?
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> always the <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many options at <unk> <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order that it presents the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of changes does not say anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways to make us a choice.
We're very excited about a product that we're building that we now have more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> we can get rid of <unk> alternate alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented with was designed to help manage the <unk> or better, to use them in their own business, or for the people who will work.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful at <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years, in the 1990s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to register a sheet of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a <unk> with the wrong message, they could track the footprint until the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this will make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having a few yellow print on every page that you follow a pattern that makes them and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> so much.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can set up the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really a lot of days of <unk> online, <unk> that they would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or they steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a computer computer.
The secret service in the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a <unk> to a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong in the worse.
In the future, most of the crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> at the importance of today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them to the protests, they motivate them, they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months in the last 12 months in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national United States that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack, against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority from the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the breakup last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site, and they took a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with representative government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So why do you serve the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except to make a foreign <unk> authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the headquarters of the secret police carried on April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was notes from a company based on Germany who had sold the Egyptian government and the tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company is <unk> right here.
I mean, Western governments give them tools to provide governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this for themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right now that we have to do today, will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a management that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cow, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate in the park.
And predators, just as the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only driver's seat, we had.
My community, the <unk> believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People were dying are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they are also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to the nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would be afraid.
But I realized that I actually didn't think that it was not <unk> because even helping male lions see the pen away.
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart --  came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were there, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, male lions didn't come.
And I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to just turn out and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
It takes everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery would break the electricity into the little <unk> box. I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give the outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how lions see it, when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have trouble with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've located in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used now from all Kenya, to freak out other predators like hooking <unk> and it's also being used by spreading elephants from farms.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International International
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So one year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna, the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes and told me that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cow cows and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electrical mines.
What's the next one in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one near you, CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they already invented robotic <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take you at a time, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> every single step of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
I even wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed from suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And that said, "When we do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks long.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very altered.
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of his mother and unable to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge starvation left up to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and only a few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more <unk> the energy cuts -- everything around me was completely on dark at night except by the lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I walked out of North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of starvation went to China to live with kin.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee camps.
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely hard, but it's also dangerous, because the North North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I would lie on the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I was able to control my emotions and put the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another one, "This was a fake report, she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking at asylum in <unk>
But many of them may be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were eventually eventually released after an international pressure rate.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work -- everyone can be <unk> at a second.
That's why, after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to try and go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I realized there was a big gap between North and South
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even walked through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea, it was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Right when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money I sent to my family, and as dear to my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to get away from immediately to get away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances, on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to go in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked them the identification of everybody and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did the whole way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards.
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short of the embassy of South Korea.
I was going on between the immigration office and the Turing station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or a voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would want to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans, and to get them to prison.
I took him out with my entire heart, and I asked him, "Why did I do?"
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when I was doing it.
And it showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the prediction that the <unk> people.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But it's only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, labor practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in touch with family parties, and we send information and money that's helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive an international support.
I'm sure that you're going to see more and more North Koreans, all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
So I live in Southern Center.
This is the <unk> <unk> stores, fast food stores -- fast food.
So the planners of the city came together and thought, let's change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed the South Los Angeles as if this is actually going to be wrong in the city.
This is the South Bronx  <unk> of <unk> food, fast food.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, the Los Angeles South Africa, home to the food sites to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to bring kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in the Los Angeles South America.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than, say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 kilometers away.
And I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home you see the <unk> effects, that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see lawn chairs and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And he also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land of land we call a <unk>
This is 45 meters by <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come up with me -- because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, Green Green <unk> we set up and started planting our forest of food, trees -- trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables go.
What we do, we are kind of a group of paid paid ahead of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the entire city and completely voluntary and everything that we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city was given me on top and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> made reverse order.
And I was like, "Come on me, on it?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's do it."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the members of the Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk> terrain.
It's 68 miles of arable terrain.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why does the hell don't look like this?
You know, a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they grow your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern Center.
I grew up there. And I grew up there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
Like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a bit of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'll be able to see what the land can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and her daughter, were like the night <unk> and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad -- and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this like that.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with starvation, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "You don't agree that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to be <unk> but at the same time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion when I put a garden in a shelter to go into the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was great, I had his stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant with his mom and their grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of people who come from, they work and put them all in a volunteer.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat some <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you're not taught how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work with, but they have this thing that they're caught. I see kids in this way that they are designed for them, which is not going to lead them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids that are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take container and turning them into healthy <unk>
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of the people, getting the boys in the street, who know joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> your <unk> your <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, they don't call me on the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Woman: Thank you.
Thank you.
You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, that it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on asphalt that we have.
And especially if you go on your bike and these automobiles go that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, have pores and water can pass through it, so all water flows into the sides and you will have a road road that is easy to drive, and you don't have any water <unk>
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very lightweight, all the noise away, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see that on this road rocks the surface of the surface are gone.
First one stone, then then a few more and more and more, and so on, and you know, you know, I'm not going to do that.  But they can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> Is it ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they were separating from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the wool of steel in very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel <unk> on it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use it to make a <unk> machine.
<unk> can be heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks get back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane <unk> to test this material.
So that's what we did in there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road would last several years without any harm.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made it age the samples, we put a lot of charge on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using <unk> power, to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It is actually got to cool first before you can show you how the cancer looks like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radio.
I had a great smile on her face that was unusual at those times, because the news usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban <unk> out of Afghanistan and made girls illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who was no longer alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspect to where they were.
We had to hide the books in stock bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father did it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It wasn't left two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments in which I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can help them leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we need to sell our blood to pay your own education, we shall.
So you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I'm a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, like my friends, they were <unk> by them, even though they were even in front of a neurological opposition in front of it.
As <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going from the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to her home, they are the phone, a voice had given him that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if you were <unk> he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter by their old daughter, <unk> ideas."
What I've been given from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter, and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the shining future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks as different from here in the U.S.
I find Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I would argue that these changes would not last last long after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, I see the <unk> future, and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never hit you a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by <unk> <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the slums, they were on the <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a bravery <unk> to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a big sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and about 50,000 loss of about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> I left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved it, next to many other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a psychological transition and just towards democracy and the national reconciliation of democracy.
These are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about developing capacity, and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we started the women's advocate of Women Women, a movement of women, leaders, a lot of <unk> to advocate for the world's autonomy autonomy of the woman and for our right engagement of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment, in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was rich and successful.
Women won an <unk> of National Congress in the first election for 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day I wake up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack to the <unk>
Another day to wake up with the news of the murder of the military material.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their supply human rights violations.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mindset -- more and away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, and we had the beginning.
The <unk> and revenge became the iconic of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to assume that we, as a nation, we choose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination.
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than we needed the elections, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the representation of women more than <unk> the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as ethical agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse -- not only <unk> but also putting the mercy instead of <unk> the <unk> instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, held by the war, desperately needs the end of reaching peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in such a existential way, before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> that is known in all the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans the humanity of the men and women, where all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of existence.
This is what he says to tell us, "My <unk> will look at all the stuff."
This is how he told us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That to all of them are <unk> the fun of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a quantum question, which has an equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that all make you very usual -- why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, I am not a social, no an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had been at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York in my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> me <unk> me on the head with a <unk> <unk>
The man, whom I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a classic <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical heart of domestic violence.
I am <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson Johnson Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been at almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all races, all religions, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence goes to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> and <unk> relationships -- and in long duration or a long duration of the families, the last place where we would want or hope to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who took it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the New York subway and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and working in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the countryside.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that he did was ever been to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially in the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- that I had gone to Harvard, that I had gone to Harvard who was passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done before.
And I was so that the bachelors degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your mate, so I <unk> left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> which was moving in the head at a physical trap, financial and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it comes to it.
And here is where they come into scene these <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where they were supposed to be so sure that they bought three <unk>
I had it in the <unk> of the car.
Another one put it under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns because of the trauma that lived small.
I needed them to feel sure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious risk every minute every day.
The first physicist <unk> <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother from my mother and married him.
Despite what had occurred, was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> from the wedding and by making a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I had never hurt me.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would take a lot of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey <unk> around the traffic and dropped me a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> followed by a couple of times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is victim of domestic violence or bullying.
So, actually, I had really good company.
To go back to my question: Why would I be <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just be <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people, because we, the victims, we know something that normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim to end the relationship, after they <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation system to return to the victim and their children, who are normally required by the judges to spend time to spend <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> that beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told you all the world: to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and relatives, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like <unk> women -- women -- <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and they would save their lives and happy lives like <unk> wives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I got marry with a man <unk> <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to ever have ever more, and it's just a loaded and pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, they are thinking, "This is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end up with the end of my particular love breaking the silence.
And I'm still doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> will be only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would love the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family and family.
<unk> their view of survivors as a fantastic and <unk> people who have a future <unk>
It would be the signs of violence in the way to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims to a safe return.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like right now, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like that.  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them right now, but you find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These results are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to go through this sweater over the head, because it is when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I take me on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I got my back and he <unk> the hair of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our own, which, although shallow and shallow <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm model, model,
Because I'm a nice, white, woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made me model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape of <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my Mexican heritage that I've known to take to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown to you, and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that <unk> Stop. So there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know as much models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every single role of models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, only <unk> -- that is less than four percent were not white than four percent.
The next question that people can always ask me is to be model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then, what would really tell you every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you are.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be impressive, because you are the first one.
If after this <unk> list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of American <unk> or American executive <unk> or next Steven <unk>
Saying most of you want to be model that you want to win the lottery when you're bigger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all what I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've been able to take your studies, and you have a copy of them and some work on your backs, no matter what you <unk> is to say, if you pretend that you want to be President of the United States, but your <unk> <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would tell you weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal land, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and at <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're creations of a professional professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people can always ask me is: "Is it for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> a red light <unk> and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> an agent and sorry, agent.
<unk> of these privileges <unk> not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of what they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the teenagers who were married and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino kids in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that to 53 percent of the girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you're expecting is, if you're a little thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative and smart and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask you, with some smaller legs and the brightest hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a set of models, because they have the most bright hair and the most brilliant hair and clothes at the way, but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But most of it was hard to analyze with racial and gender oppression when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the focus that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was great enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't go to my <unk>
There were no <unk> and no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of careful on lighting.
In fact, most of them took a random tourists at random.
My story begins when, in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. This is the corner of the 57 and the 5.
He just happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> trip, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the tourists who had to tell us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became really sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened in the way that a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way of stopping time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always get the same picture, our daughter changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, on one of the trips, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the pirate pirate shop, which <unk> of the little <unk>
And I described what I had felt at five years standing in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participate in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out in many family pictures.
I am always the one who gets the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to show up in the picture, and not <unk> to get someone and asked him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the most <unk> <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, by 11 different risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> who are important, and first of all, they provide vital <unk>
They are our natural <unk>
They took the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that not because they would stretch and cause great loss of livestock and disease in other animals.
Studies recent have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the dead people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have enormous <unk> importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and under Egypt.
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're going to be very important to open open to open sky in places like Europe -- there is no place to bury the dead or bury the dead -- so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which is about six of them are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities, <unk> use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they drop from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb to <unk> The number of cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> will be up to the top of the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind power, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? OK, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a private problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help help? It can become assets to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed by opinion because he saw them flying without effort, without the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to a young man, but I no longer am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> at the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything I would do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got out of <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach them to local tomatoes to grow Italians and <unk> and and ...
And of course, people were not at all in all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were sure that the local people in so fertile -- they didn't have agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not going to do anything, we just said, "Thank you to God that we're here."  <unk> to time to save the people in Zambia of <unk>
And of course, all in Africa was grown <unk>
So we got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, that's why we have no agriculture here --  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only about all of the Italians would invest in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, the United States would do, what the English would do, and then see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's see the <unk>  <unk> will see the waste that we would join the <unk> people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western <unk> we have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the United States <unk> which means <unk>
And yet, they mean two different things.
I try to make any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a stick on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to be 27 years just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have never really motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk>
So what do you do? They <unk>
It would never get to a community with an idea, and feel with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give any idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for one time, they were <unk> but not in the community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what have you a <unk>
So planning has this blind.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know this before, because they don't deal with their public meetings.
What do we do? We worked with one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor for the company, the family physician in the business, that gets to you in your house, at the table of his kitchen, and it helps to find the resources to transform their passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this condescending <unk> where we got to tell them what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to see to ask, "How can you do that?
So how do you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
So I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business academic academic academic academic career in history ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy of philosophy before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
planning is the kiss of death of the business of business.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you this, and you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you will have to come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What is you going to talk more about this morning, you know?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial Industrial Revolution, <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk>
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that was in a <unk> journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> this group of people gathered together this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty <unk> technology that would be in New York City.
So what does it happen? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States <unk> generic companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were a very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to get to talk with you.
And then you have to offer an absolute <unk> dedicated <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth with it about <unk>
The smallest company, the company bigger, has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have some financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and find the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not not born.
We have looked at and looked at 100 companies iconic from the Carnegie <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: No one was started by one person.
You would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who are coming from a little <unk> business environment in bars and in bars and their comrades who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did in this gentleman is talking about this <unk> somebody who's going to ask you, what would it take?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
You can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our own needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the poison giants who give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always stops the music.  There's a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest abandoned properties in the U.S.
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and conservative.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led me deep gratitude for the time of living and so on.
It gives it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I would try to keep this look at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be <unk> for <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before they die, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before they die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live out of the <unk>
Before I died, I want to tell you one time more."
Before they die, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laughing <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving us the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center, we made a kit, and they've now made up walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and to remember that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that are more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces shared can be better than what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please, don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's very <unk>
No speech, but it brings better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happens what's going on.
It's not <unk> You can't see the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice about this: It's never <unk>
When they perform songs of our childhood, trying to be a word of the ones that I couldn't even even know I could remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> memory <unk>
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you had a pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like amazing?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society, they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what he pushed my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, which is a different way of Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It takes a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't look very interested in myself at all.
He was living and lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I would be pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the <unk> looking at the washing machine, to eat anything that was <unk>
As it was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent, a child that would see the world without <unk> a human being that never had.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about bringing communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by the beauty that give us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could take one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside of your inner and, frankly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the moment that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, giving a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> from these students with their great minds, their big books and their great unknown individuals.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just so I sat down when I had those conversations with the students, they surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges from energy to the environment and health care, each other, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go to <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and his engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that we study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, careful with the <unk>
The jargon is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make silly things.
Instead, as Einstein, said Einstein, that everything as easy as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways to hook them up and engage with their content.
And when you introduce your work, forget about signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it is being held too much in the language of our brain and we are <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that the only design of the Eiffel Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a very simple sentence: <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then then providing graphs to <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what you're going to be.
I think these are just some key key that they can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that are science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the Oxford English Midwest, is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined them much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks a public <unk> no matter what a game or a game -- and that, when he won, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced by <unk>
He got her on the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk>
Most people think it's a literal thing.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you could have <unk>
Some wanted to call him <unk> of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about testing quality.
And not even with that was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there could be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get rid of power.
They didn't want to call him King if he would give him to him or her dear ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> the more <unk> <unk> <unk> that came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a low title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign the treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take in serious with a very ridiculous title and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama are lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we can keep it waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this I want to suggest to you -- is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of the air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have led to the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, looking at it, well, it was a uniqueness by the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the kind of 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to tell you about it.
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes a lot more the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices who talk about but, especially that cacophony of <unk> male and stones stones with primitive.
Like the other ones, I carry a cheap flashlight of light, strapped her into the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that you hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
She <unk> my hand and all of a sudden I remember a <unk> I met days earlier, who lost control and dropped countless feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are in deep deep in that hole at risk their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they may never be diagnosed with slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only person in the Peace Summit <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there met a <unk> <unk> an NGO who was dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, began to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world but not such a grade.
When we ended up talking very <unk> I was honestly <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them would even consider them my second home.
But this time, we got the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as many African Africans during the entire slave slave for all the slave slave together.
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
It's the equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
And yet, today you can take entire families for entire families by injecting 18 percent <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13 billion value per year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false <unk> and better work for us to find out they are forced to work without a threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves are value, but those who produce them are disposable ones.
The slavery exists in almost everybody and yet, it's illegal in all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was <unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families in a heavy escape.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16  17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, and not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned too hot to touch, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, like, my camera gets a much better treatment for these people.
Back in blast I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't know it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release and he trusted what he was doing it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found young children by dragging rocks for miles through <unk> land and trucks who were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children than the library and the children are going to put them into their heads with leg, made from clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're a slaves -- and they work 16  17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They don't have anything that <unk>
When these villagers get rid of their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness I was advised that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
And I took me out of a <unk> <unk> that would give this <unk> dirty <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're <unk>
They have small rooms and private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every single place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From standing in the <unk> I remember making sense of a sharp acute fear and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs by where they were going.
There was no <unk>
There were no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a hard issue -- it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, The New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as a slave soldiers.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there was entire families in the trade of the silk.
This is a portrait of family.
<unk> hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We will still be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two younger brothers, some younger children, make sense of it?
<unk> were all the slaves.
Children are separated from their families -- <unk> and forced to work extensive in these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
It was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of tree branches in the <unk> lake will often trap networks and children, and <unk> and in fear, you get thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of people are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to run away, and as a whole life has been treated with cruelty, the younger slaves in their command.
I met these guys at five of the morning, when we were <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working from the one one of the time.
It was <unk>
And I would have to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> to the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who is going to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would join us out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we began to go down, we took the <unk> and we took the path and after walking near an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they were <unk> on these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in an clear, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of migrant workers.
A lot of women had children bound by their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pit they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his naked eyes, because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to take up to 90 feet and these people carry together heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they would be able to get the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look more closely, the margin is working at other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> of mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, he <unk> I had a debt of the uncle to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, it's got tuberculosis and even though that is forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw a light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to get witness to them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are real people, like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day to happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, I think I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images get a force in those of you who you see in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math applied and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like the management scientists.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activity.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later.
But the <unk> demand is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a certain <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurologic disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a <unk> ballet ballet <unk>
Over the last few years has been made a lot on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement there are no <unk> and so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, never become done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
It would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do the test they <unk>
It wouldn't be <unk>
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to think about as a conventional way to try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration from string <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sound to speak, and we can imagine as a dancers of a trained baby because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the needed genes -- the <unk> for example.
And like the lessons, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time you bring a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as the <unk> and as well as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the plot of the bottom of you can see an example of <unk> <unk> from string <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> Well, but also exams, based on voice aren't <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
And when something takes a cost that's so <unk> it shows mass scale.
These are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce the patient difficulties in the patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for the <unk>
<unk> <unk> could be able to get objective data.
We could make it a <unk> mass of cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
And so when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's Initiative.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start dealing with these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's, I can call at the price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's try to take all these samples of, say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What's happening is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> they may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the real markers of the disease.
TR: They have a precision <unk> at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have <unk> has done fantastic work and now has been shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we have to do is we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're creatures, gray.
We become <unk> in the dark, <unk> rooms and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect we do the impossible, possible and we're going to focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the events that were going on in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where it was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> people located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime and we leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- dead fish -- <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> and cameras and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They go and take them to different places from villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were running from the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It was helped by cleaning the toilets, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And so they had the honor and I had the honor that that day would be in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far as my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the photos, I found some who had more than a hundred years some of them still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had a lot of precision and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as having a picture of it.
Over the step of time, they got more lucky and more <unk> and it took more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village in Northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the U.S. <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time I <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the course of the <unk> of the photos.
I could engage an hour. I could be <unk>
I could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw on virtually by hand, using a guide and areas whose color and detail water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures served in saltwater covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with oil, all of it with the passage of time, I continue <unk> so I went to hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't look at the picture unless it was clean dry and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a guide from a neighbor <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos already <unk>
As once he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> she himself but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to replicate it, we were able to put the images in a single picture, and they did the whole picture.
When I picked up his photos shared some of his story with us.
Some colleagues in his husband found photos in a fire station between the rubble quite far from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but their two children were at school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
She took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photos at least 14 years old.
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past day that he hadn't been marked by the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined them -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up by more <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority came to their hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 50 into teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We took pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we might have but the first thing they would look for.
So this was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone else with the past.
When a picture like this, you get a huge difference in the life of the person who comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to bring it back, using their talent to something that are not distributed robotic skin.
To conclude, I would like to read this electronic email. I sent him the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, and I was embarrassed because a little bit of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few times our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> were inspired by wonder and curious about this picture of a bullet traveling through an apple in a single one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
So I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technical technique that can create a slow motion of the light on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they actually defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it up and put it up in a <unk> <unk> in a second -- you can create a bunch of photons just a millimeter of a wide millimeter in just one millimeter long.
And that packet of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a bullet has a common.
If we took that bullet and this little package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk> camera.
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to take up the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light on motion.
Now, Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
So the pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a golf package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally arrive at the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
In that time, waves travel around the table, and because of the insights in the top of the top of the side, you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and <unk> and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us sit to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a bullet slow motion.
And what about testing <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table, the tomato cord and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more and more and realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside your inside, and it comes back after several <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at MIT? MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of a <unk> photograph that goes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> so you could barely go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that packet of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all this data into crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can be flying.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. I will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the speed of light.
So we know distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what a point corresponds to what a distance.
So when I project a laser project you can record a <unk> <unk> which, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the object itself.
We can see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the back of the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to the curve, to
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected through open windows together.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and blood -- this is pretty difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new metabolic modality to solve the problems of healthcare to the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it turned science in art, an art of photographs in <unk>
I realized that all the data <unk> that we harvest is not just for scientific views -- but we can be able to do it.
We create a new form of computer photography, with slow code and color code.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> in a second.
But here is also a funny thing.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going off of us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects.
The order for the events in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can make your life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a cell phone, you can take a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, put her up to <unk> and make it big.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> in search of a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who is a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, about my cellphone, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
So these are 35 different lines of information.
<unk> data in gross.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is that every European phone company, every single telephone company in all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sent an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at at least six months, and even two years, in its phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers <unk> all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, and priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information on us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please get me back to the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to her, and I didn't have a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a lawsuit and I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, he agreed.
<unk> the demand and they'd send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court -- <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly bit about brown with a CD in it.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> of information.
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I went to night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to be <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk> of data.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom up and fold up, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what hour you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who you send an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of the <unk>
Because today state agencies and companies want to store so much information about us as possible within and off the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want them to do it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a century value of the 21st century, and it's not been <unk>
When you go home to their representative to their representative of all, because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remember that you have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we have a lot of time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't get it.
Nobody <unk> the uterus, of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were a siblings, although they are.
It's only by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of us to be there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas Day, they're in the shopping center, drive around and <unk> and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim disabled woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial age.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral brain cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was: "You can <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> me <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system and get married, that I was also out of it, and if I didn't take all the ultimate note -- all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years old, putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a baseball choir has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and still in the family,  I think nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like <unk>
The people I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of people who died of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating the dawn of dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine -- all the <unk> we were interested in <unk>
At the summer vacation I often my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk <unk> on the back, <unk> me in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> me and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And I can now focus on the head.
My parents would tell me this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
All of us <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least <unk> I took the highest note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a play called <unk> so slow on Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with a <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end, it was <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying in crying as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they thought I could not make the risk of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the scenes, you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper that I literally had been born and was given to an enemy without cerebral palsy,
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disability for disabled paper.
When I was talking, I went home, and my first tour tour was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> were not going to be <unk> <unk>
Just give people perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour tour, I took New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he landed on the realization that I was at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs all over the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I do know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the media directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the delivery of stigma disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program has been invited by Keith <unk>
I walked into a dance dance I went back to a studio and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held on to the desktop desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they won't have me.
But not just Mr. <unk> he went back to <unk> but I was sort of <unk> and pasted my chair.
A lot of fun I learned on right with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never got <unk> of me or any older girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite is my favorite favorite one.
What disease is it?
We really should pray for her."
A guy suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If anyone in the wheelchair can't do any <unk> then <unk> can't make somebody in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- Yes, <unk> man.
The disabled minority are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need to need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> on the red carpet of the <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Muslim world, "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in this big state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The children of <unk> a charity organization to give the children who were Palestinians who Palestinians a tiniest little bit of what my parents were going to do.
It was the only time my father saw me being live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities -- there's no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing.
A day a gentleman is offered to bring it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money so that you buy new clothes -- money to send her family.
I present to a young man.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That child from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization by al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him.
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came along.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And its story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban young urban <unk> who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for jobs, of well-being, but young people don't engage in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities are under 18 years.
If we do not include the young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, he was 70 percent of the young people who are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders in a business enterprise.
It took to about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat and we had an rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate college college -- frustrated, was the perfect white thing for Al <unk> and other Indian organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> Rome to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is at some time expanding hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the spirit of the corporate spirit and I think the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunity that are looking for so desperately people.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was forced to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw it <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
A company started a <unk> design company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> who said he could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for marriages, creating gardens in the houses, and the companies in the city, and now is working in the creation of the first public <unk> park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink ones.
By the way, he doesn't feel pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO NGOs, working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They have business solutions for local problems.
So inspired the young people and create a cultural spirit culture, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to go into development and put their business set.
They go to young people with the resources that they need, and they support the support that they need to move from understanding to the creation, and create a <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park of <unk> is how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from paralysis from <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to be the young people in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and you'll have more stories about flowers and Parks of <unk> than <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> Mountains an area in northern New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be the way that we were <unk> almost to be able to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with cardiac hearts with apple <unk> baby balls, old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where they do <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, and it was 11 tons of waste from waste and two billion tons of products, every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and I interviewed people in office and facilities throughout the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I began to work like trash.
Now I was not just going to travel in our trucks. And I was <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one is going to be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for a number of years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the waste waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and entering the traffic all the day and they go around around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck, and make terrible harm.
I also learned about how relentless the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is as a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And there are also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important labor on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way of each day, this starts to <unk> from its container and its dangers inherent to help us in very real ways.
And so we had been controlled by decades and centuries and centuries they come back to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for the new things that the economy of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered people.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed we need.
And so I mean simply at the speed at the rate that used to move in the contemporary time.
We don't usually care about it, and we would not have to hurt them, and we took our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a work force on the other side that it would be required to do.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a kind of relief.
The flow that keep us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste in the street, I grabbed my son and I got the stairs running the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as it did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "Let's be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to research the waste and went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species -- we need to include all the cost, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the nation.
This is a remarkable statistic one.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next to see someone whose job is to clean out of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent project as an example of this.
Both projects are located in countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, to my team and me, what we had to design about.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to spend a lot of energy because the skin on the crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what you see has nothing to do with Africa nor with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted to the ancient market that is this structure of free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small monkey <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to you the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs on the building.
And it extends out with a <unk> atrium, that creates a space of open space in the building that would be driven by its own shape, and the rain and rain.
And around this space we've been looking at the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be attached to local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also of light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in her <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't get easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the mall to be able to sell it to <unk>
And also the idea of the facade was extremely economic, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy energy to the building in a city where the electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is gathering water for the <unk>
It waits for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a project that is so big that I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their surroundings, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in <unk> a structure of a thousand years old that was surrounded by a <unk> wall connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets by creating 12 early blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best guidance for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So they set up a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that have a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving us the space that the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and make a activities such as a race of two miles in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, you have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but we're going to argue that the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as <unk> as you see all the new girls.
I had great amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was very strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my little plan.
I got a time after the <unk> I was a bit late and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took the table from my teacher to my TED book.
And then, I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit of this.
All of these.  And I set out to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows from <unk> and I went to myself a row of it, just to be there, just to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good about doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It was all <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was feeling the reason why I was bothered with this little girl that was so good for me.
They <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also, the primates. The birds are really <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that you would take -- or long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study them in all its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, <unk> would have not literature.
Well, I would not have <unk> <unk> or <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I took the reading lists of my high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without intervention, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the galaxies almost got the all.
So this year, 100 years of his work will look for the <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary legal <unk> my God, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forget how hard it is that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how it's <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the galaxies that are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a good <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel neurons, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details we would do to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> make all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another one, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> in his lover adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links the language <unk> with the <unk>
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of course, listening to the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search of knowledge, search of truth, a painful truth, in fact, how much more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a lot of deep feelings and vital life than a wise man who can tell us <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to go for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we would give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at very <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his woman would take it.
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get into what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspected without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
And the novels are very good at how <unk> make us look at intensity, but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> take us to make violent acts or illegal acts of violent acts by this.
<unk> lead us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, I am sorry, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since which was sent <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when I heard this, I was going to come up with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- even though creativity -- right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel by Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try and make our minds match our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of intervention, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> at a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to invade your self and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your rings, take your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in the times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> that needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> it in each of those kinds of mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six percent, once they <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> comes back to <unk> and says, "Not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so easy.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used to the <unk> calls the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary piece Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the greatest <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July of July, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo Apollo <unk> of Apollo 11.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in gray surface was the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the largest Nature <unk> in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities, and government agencies.
<unk> including the <unk> of Apollo one.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which went out after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent of the <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the same words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask why <unk>
Why turn it to our goal?
And you might ask, why can I scale the most <unk>
Three years ago, why would fly over the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the east of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have the technology that Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a boat with a candle, but in 1969, the <unk> of Apollo 10 foot <unk>
Since 1970, no human being has gone to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> of Apollo 10, and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we think of problems that we imagine that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> tube of the rocket.
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but it was completely sure that I had to see the colonies on Mars.
So that influences it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists like the technologists would have distracted us, and they had enriched toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an unfair explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that they have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from MIT, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by creating ideas that are <unk> by funding <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high time without worrying about the risk, they preferred low investments as small as they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long time -- they have not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's global energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want some alternative sources of alternative energy that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international deals with the development of <unk> energy, make a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control cost of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an average energy policy or international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of the failure of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was declared the war in 1971, but soon we found that there are many cancer types of cancer, some stable types of damage to treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult to be hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> and the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, and the institutions have to support the <unk> it must really be about a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems, does it happen with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like the <unk> of the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be straightforward.
It was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that it's not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a major decline in trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why don't people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will start to think that there may have dropped in some activities or institutions and there could be increased in others.
I have no one.
But I can turn to the polls of opinion, and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years is still quite <unk> by the other ones.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost at almost half the way.
But is this evidence for enough?
What peer opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would ask you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I would probably be able to say, "Who will ask what?"
And that would be a very intriguing response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust you for some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust confidence.
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or type of person, or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the class class but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we stop all that knowledge when we think about confidence in more <unk>
I think those surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence, because they try to get them to good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
This is not that the goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust that it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's all about is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not socially unable to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't have a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are really sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are environmentally competent, but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been surprised.
But that's what we are looking at before we do that before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems from accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said to me, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the grim <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the system of accountability is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people that have to do difficult tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
Of course, all of you know similar examples.
You know, all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we have to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that are reliable and whether they try to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct some trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust trust, it's <unk> because they give us a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the bases enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make sure that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, does the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> without giving explanations.
I take them and get it back to me and make it change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination is <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen, and the power of computing -- has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and I would have no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First I created this tool that gets back into the digital space, so that when the strong thing on the screen is going on the open screen to the pixel body.
So designers can take care of their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool you break up.
But the two hands still remain out of the screen.
How do you go inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent wind bombsight with a depth of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, you get inside of 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, it's as easy as grab a book of a <unk>
You can look through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual <unk> sensor that there's the bottom of every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information comes towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and turning things into the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists so that we can make them <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical continent.
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which implies that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and <unk> and <unk>
And by planning the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movement can be <unk> and will go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can reproduce as a physical reality sometimes that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics movement, and unlike the monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something that is going to begin to act directly over us as part of the physical world around us without having us from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to bring to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After you survive the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was just a <unk> path towards <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera opera singer, though.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could do to go to the opera school.
So even I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life was a second class happiness was all the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved looking for another <unk>
No one to my <unk> <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I'm going to do here?
Those who were anywhere in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a universal convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
And so it became my tool to get out of this trap. guilt and to start my relationship with my parents.
And I find it with a new culture also led to my cognitive reading habit too.
It takes a lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map I was looking out of place because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research camps like comparative and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it as well as <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path from <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> path Alan <unk> -- instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used or <unk>
Having a really broken sleep, it's really not compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, is where the dreams, is where happiness comes from.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a graduate student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex came to the first session wearing jeans and a <unk> I jumped on the couch my office and he told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner partner had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy to just move the head while we were going to get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I saw it, she was right.
You start to work after that, then you have children later, even the death spends later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had a lot of time.
But soon after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press that talking about his life <unk>
I was surprised.
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like if it was to marry him."
And so my squad <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe they get stuck with the next.
Moreover, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of hyperbolic was a real problem and had real consequences not only to Alex and his love life, but for the careers, families and future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think of anyone in the age of age, without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream -- a <unk> I want to see. All right.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give their life to have been in the time when they have 30 and <unk>
And over 40 people, I don't get to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're going out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and they were <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change itself, is now time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top of the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to focus on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your common life has an <unk> impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical time in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of the time.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence
The reporters were <unk> names of <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency, and his ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart intelligent, interesting things like you or your children and girls get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this is not true -- I'm just killing time."
Or say, "Everybody says that as you start a career before 30, all will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running around and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he turned the music and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one that was going to be stop, so I sometimes think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it's not going to make the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, pick a city, choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is a research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying the red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said you'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a very difficult time, their previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she was getting up to say, "One doesn't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day, Emma got his head on his legs and <unk> for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his whole little <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was their opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit and sit while the 19th decade of Emma went on.
So over the next few weeks, and months, I told Emma three things that every single man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who are <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to do it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration exploration, I'm exploring the exploration that I shouldn't count -- which, by the way, isn't exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make it tell.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who you know, what you know, how to think about, how to think about, how they are talking, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is going to come out almost always comes from his nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call a hundred <unk> friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
The half of the jobs created never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is how to get a job not published yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the information is going on.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a partner and there is her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 percent is better than 30 or even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person who you live now or tell you now when all Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that implies to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who is to be <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate a quarter of a cousin who was working in an art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job there.
That work of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living one who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
He <unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I sent me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency outcomes are not good enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy for them.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out of the L.A. airport that come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21.
Here's my idea worth all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to tell you about it.
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity, get their identity, you get their identity, you get their own <unk>
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I took test tests and tests.
I give you tasks.
When I work back, it was <unk>
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough.
After several years more <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure <unk>
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and rapid way that easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied professors who are working in really difficult difficult, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, what about these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts emerged as a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good and good health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a good career.
A few years ago, I began to study determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination they had significantly greater likely to get older, even when the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the clinical trials, even the safety that the kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not only at West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, what science knows about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development do the determination in kids?
What do I have to do to teach kids a ethical ethic.
How do we keep it for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I do know is that talent doesn't give <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data and the serious determination is not related or related to <unk>
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be <unk> when they fail, because they don't think that failure will be a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, and we have to be willing to fail, to start to start to start all over again.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you might want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning that Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simpler way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic wisdom.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read the <unk> <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
They make a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of <unk> in the old west <unk>
And I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the ancient said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person reaches their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big one.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a question like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> to remember, because a rubber speaker is pretty an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three units together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> there is someone at home?
This person is going out of a door hidden from the door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, have care of <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile is become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The <unk> film is their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic bullet.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we bring our children into a kind of a industrial complex of child <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a kid <unk> <unk> a girl in her as her <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
The other single thing about the magician of Oz is that the most educated and masculine characters, are women.
I began to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
three years old.
It wasn't invited to projection, because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So so slid in the room and was slid in the room and was amazed as a leg with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
It would be themes of value, resilience and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke got a military to <unk> to the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your movie?
And doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow <unk> OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of course, as F, force force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for the experience that the princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that would have been served to navigate by the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss I was hoping that the credit of whom would appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they still there?
I don't know what I have to do.
The movies are focused on defeat and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be an animal dumb, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and defend the <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though kids, they're not really their target audience.
They do phenomenal work by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time is continuing to show up in classical after classic each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and son, or two men who bred a child.
Up until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out there.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let that get that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not that roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of a friend on the assessment of the films that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do, in the movie, there is more than a female character than I have lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the boy who you like.  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women there are and they talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right?
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think that I <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep conversations and deep and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the bankers to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
And so it <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 popular movies how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen to have recently for Congress, so it's fine.
But there is a bigger number than this one that is going to spread out this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what I was like, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually abused in his life.
I don't think it's the <unk>
I don't think movie movies have something to do with that.
I also don't think that video videos or pornography, are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to beat the <unk> with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic -- and we want to make it away.
We have tools to be available to our disposal as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to ask it, but I have to ask you, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we need to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man box, is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was from "Star <unk> you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to protect their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories that I'm going to say to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where her work looked like her work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I loved most was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that it would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're just covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I would tell you to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally I started studying <unk> I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a nearly 3,000 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different the <unk> can look like.
This is a place located in the eastern Delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked view, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using some false color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data, to find a <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle East about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in El <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right on the side of <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try to find the equivalent of the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this dramatic area that you see inside the circle here, which we thought could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing labor work, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of showing you in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick <unk> layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found work of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a workshop shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry jewelry, these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer, of occupation that goes from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would bring to the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle East, probably been written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to me, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually begin in 1984 B.C. in a lost city, not for a lot of time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I would like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now I put a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They are competing in a bus <unk> and they go back to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles everywhere, wheels that go on to their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door.
The lobby, in the hall, or what there is on the side of the door, and you look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
It's from his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> getting tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> fortune and you're going to go into your mouth.
They walk around and enter their living room.
In the room, and doing much use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing about their <unk> <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now I went to the kitchen.
The land has been coated with a yellow <unk> path and the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I suppose, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, they were looking at them just once.
The names of tens and tens of strangers.
It took entire poems in just minutes.
I was able to see who could memorize the fastest of the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook, who had come from England and that has one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked him, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who's involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, we've been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old old techniques invented in Greece, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their speeches, and that the <unk> academics were using it to memorize books.
And my reaction was, "How do you have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English one, although a little bit <unk> he told me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live, in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to figure out how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a guy named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
And this was an incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see so far as our memory does that we are.
In the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went on a afternoon together at the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides was <unk>
And at the back, I read a number of treaties on memory that was over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory -- not one thing as rare as you might find today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed.
We've changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed the cognitive <unk>
As we almost have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this competition as unique of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College of London invited to a group of memory, to the lab.
They wanted to know, to be that it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of the memory and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI MRI scanner, they <unk> their brains as they look at numbers, expensive faces and <unk> they found that in the memory campaign <unk> different parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive <unk> is running as an armed career where each year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> de <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize them in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> digits <unk>
In a half hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these arguments, absolutely all the techniques used to the end of the end that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you. <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who said that his name is <unk> is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to do is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name, which doesn't really mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> hats.
They have <unk>
They get a good time when they come home to work.
Probably a <unk>
And when you <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story goes like this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
He had been hired as a entertainment, because if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring to a <unk> you get a <unk>
He stood up standing foot, and he got his memory poem, and he got <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> <unk>
Let's go all of us.
But it didn't only kill them all, but it shattered the bodies to <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
And so they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
We stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, closed eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where she had been sitting every single way every single way in my face.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions or word numbers for the word of our colleagues, we have visual visual and space exploration.
If I would tell you that I would give you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely that they would find them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse text bars, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the picture, more <unk> to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory, the same way he would have done it, if they had invited them to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And I would remember you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk about would be that strange journey they did for a year and have some friends to help them remember it.
That's like the speakers -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not word for word, who will confuse them but typical of the typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his memory nests.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got filled with it.
I went to some of these memory skills and had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone else sits on the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> <unk> <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it is actually about doing is to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some security security glasses covered with just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could actually put it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good enough for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers, and actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. Tell them that they work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need it to build memory <unk> or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the more basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace, these memory skills are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> actually.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> sort of a deep processing -- a kind of complete attention processing that most of them is not going to be wrapped up there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would say -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around our side -- we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even believe in processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are full memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person you remember memories.
Thank you.
Today I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so let's just take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old and living there at a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom as a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everyone was looking at the TV. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone coming up to me, and every time I got <unk> and I got back in a towel, all I can see.
And I was like this.
He was <unk> not and he hated it.
<unk> that <unk> I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, nor in the area of the areas, but of those synaptic connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we are feeling that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you ask you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it, because of a building two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the U.S. 20th century, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is frightening.
It's expensive, it's expensive, it's very complicated.
And the people that are going to be <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> he has this round thing, he has this round thing round -- columns, brick red -- who leave <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that drive new technologies, new technologies -- new solutions for today's life forms of life.
We were giving them we sort of <unk> and we gave it so much, that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We have to go on to the other side and go back with those symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we make it swing the way back to go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
They get small <unk> on a <unk> scale.
Something really really hard.
So we got to the '80s, and we began to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the back to the other direction.
We took those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we became a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic fantasies of our own.
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
You may be able to be a stick of sticks of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated the memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making it swing back to the other direction.
In the early '80s, and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new <unk> design techniques for computer, and we found new <unk> a few ways that were attached to other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public critical and public <unk> were completely agree on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
<unk> in Bilbao grew up on two thousand when they ended up the building.
So, all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennium, it has a new star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to spend with all of the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
Technology <unk> You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years ago, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before I know if that I designed four years ago -- was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, to be in both extreme extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now make <unk> symbols of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, it was a part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the finished, there was exactly the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and they shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with our collective memory. And by adding these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building would be built today, first of all, on the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there's no single answer to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> <unk> which doesn't have seen before.
The architects may listen, and you don't leave them <unk> by the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted as a modern city.
And this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a single historical array of red brick with ideas that should be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will go to the whims of nature and not the other.
This means that a parking garage in Miami in Miami Florida, can also serve to make a sport or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> in New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the united community around that cause, is no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built what we built is what we built.
The architects already know how to make more and smarter buildings and more kind.
We have been waiting for everyone to you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the more <unk> new libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it really great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It turns out and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all your friends do this and my mom realize I used to do it. And I got to think, How did I couple this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people search for Google, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and he lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite his mom that he tells him all the time she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
And what his mom says to tell him and what his friends or fellow school friends say, doesn't know who you believe.
So a video of her itself, he puts it on YouTube, and asking others to please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a healthy and normal <unk> who receives these answers in one of the most vulnerable life stages of their lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to me -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected, we have never been so connected, in a way, so young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There is just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, as we are always connected; it's attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of <unk> that have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is deemed digitally.
What is the highlight of somebody in the life of someone in a single context every day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk> of the girls now.
<unk> of size, zero to <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who do that, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars, like the <unk> stars, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be wise individuals themselves.
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our children spending more time and effort to their appearance, the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical lives, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as <unk> to society and the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom class class.
One in five are not coming to class at all of the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of exams, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you're good enough, you will make a note lower than the average of your fellow fellow people who don't care about it.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China, and China.
And it becomes regardless of what these young people are.
So, to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The <unk> of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with time do less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, they are involved in more diets you don't healthy than they can bring them to a food mess that they can bring them to a food disorder at all.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all because of what they make more <unk> like alcohol of alcohol and of drugs, diets <unk> surgery -- sexual activity, sexual activity, and without protection and <unk>
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be that we'd like to do that today.
It will be this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three keys. The first is that we need to nurture trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images, and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of great <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not just going to have a positive impact but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family and friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be crucial to any willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to continue for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in slices of hair, or the size of their <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the <unk> of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by making responsibility for the kind of images and feedback that we put in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together like communities, as governments and companies like companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow up to support their entire person, to support their <unk> diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that go out on the big screen because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them -- where they think they think they are never going to be aware of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
To her <unk>
To her <unk>
To her <unk>
His <unk>
It could just be just the woman who is at two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he was <unk> by not having long legs -- more <unk> a more <unk> feet -- lower <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this and make it clear to his potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the imagery is <unk>
But let's give our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and why they do, and as they make us feel.
They go to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year old year will become agents of insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the top five of November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> came into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
At <unk> they were initially suffering, but being a prisoner by other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, could not be <unk>
Later <unk> would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an <unk> engineer with a love <unk> mother of elementary school school among the two made everything possible for me to give me happy childhood, giving me happy.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most of the Muslims, come to meet.
In expertise I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we need to use all the possible means for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he was arrest me and explained to me that in the last weekends, he and some friends had been going to train training on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> shot -- which we didn't know our group was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold his <unk> on my shoulder, and explained to me how to point at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot up, I gave the little orange light on the target and for all of all, especially the goal in fire.
My uncle went back to others, and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was a moment of pack and get to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white man, but it will be the new of the class class, quiet and <unk> was enough.
So most of the time happened at home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say, <unk> -- for growing <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
And I would call me <unk> by judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they had to test my thinking was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the theme of juvenile violence, as I had been victim to <unk> almost all my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done was, friendship, Jewish was Jewish people.
It took several days to go out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all the life had been done to me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay men were bad enough.
I had a chance to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that many of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others -- but it was not easy for me to treat smart people, exactly how I would have wanted to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is about being homosexual but I know what is to be an <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he turned my shape into a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to keep my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and she said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, some of you who are trying to bring violence to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, which even though I went to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it for the victims of the terrorism and their loved pain and the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak, against those <unk> acts as rejection to my father's actions.
With this simple simplicity I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent at any religion or race -- that the children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is project in your minds.
It's an incredible film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound from what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has thin and texture.
He feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths to the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie of your own, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make you more directly.
At least, I know that I have an <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that would be <unk> what we got to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective to happen.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, that vision.
Now, psychology studied behavioral behavior, neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real blowout, a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Nancy took a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they get in.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> as life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors -- how they operate the <unk> how they work, how they are <unk> how they are adapted and <unk> the living organisms, and they're all questions about how target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we think about how we speak, how we play <unk> all are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain, so great. We get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't really know how.
With one anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are at the beginning <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you need to do, is to explain function <unk> brain behaviors and then studies everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the radical kind that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is limited.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic ones.
Rather, it looks like principles, and that's what the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws of Newton. So he applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, and so -- mass charge, then a matter of logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental way, a fundamental brick brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, the space, the time, the mass, physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can see them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what I'm looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
So this vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, every system is conscious, not only humans, and dogs mice, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> -- the elementary particles.
Even one <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling, <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy, for you.
How did anyone think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea is <unk> it's much less for different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And they're supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, as quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness as well.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies us underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, like, "Where is the fire <unk>
From vision -- the equations of physics can be allowed to be, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, consciousness is what you put in fire in equations.
In that view, consciousness isn't found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there.
So this vision -- I think, <unk> has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a lot of serious ethical and ethical implications.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything to have a consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> you take that vision, you get a lot of hunger.
I think this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious if it is.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problem on the ethical ethic of intelligent computers and ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for your collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk -- right now, we have a collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing that of a second, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how are those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it from night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, one under education.
I went to school, I went down with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to hold them for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful -- but there's an absolute problem.
She doesn't actually get anything."  And she was right.
I went to school, I had good notes. After school, I had a low profile on my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a middle school in a <unk> high school just after about 20 minutes in the kind of <unk> <unk> a boy and he said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you eat?
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people in lawn chairs talk about <unk> <unk>
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't -- and not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, <unk> people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this <unk> stage at what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we've lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something called <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong with and living with a disability makes it remarkable.
It's not bad and it doesn't make it <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the little girl without drawing a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> inspiration.
And I use the porn porn term, because we would take a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will be <unk> as a benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been tackled by strangers -- to tell you that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get some things.
But the things we <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And I need the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to take the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So, is it really fair to be in the way we do that, and share those <unk>
When people tell us, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "I'm not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all.
However, not <unk> I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to raise your mobile phone trick on your phone battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The single disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A bunch of smiles in the front of the stairs has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not get the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a library and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of the people with disability that we would be <unk> by bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the moral achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade in a classroom in <unk> is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a wheelchair <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about it does it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but reality is <unk> not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know that, because reality is augmented by changing our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to be <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game of <unk> to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man of 110 pounds can be <unk> trying to get them out of it.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I took some videos to show you what the Google was using under the shell, and I'll give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices. Because the idea of the <unk> technology is a sub going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a few time.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football camp from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
It's about a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know many of you know.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, because of this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a <unk> video, <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I could be <unk> running by the <unk> throwing the ball down to the bottom of the network?  Or they would be doing a <unk> to <unk>
What will their experience be when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality -- <unk> reality when we <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> in Baltimore gave him a <unk> to his field <unk> so that she would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to make it <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, much faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put the <unk> in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group and you see your next move in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing on. You don't have to worry about going to forget a <unk>
Or the <unk>
They just come out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate <unk>
If you do lose parties, you like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your form of playing the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are below.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will be <unk>
This is going to make good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that you're the field <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
I went to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your Norden bombsight -- you know, a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It would take to the protection of protection.
Another <unk> will you tell you that there's an open receiver there.
You get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receiver see in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The great audience and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion on the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use <unk> reality to encourage empathy between human beings to show someone how it's literally going to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how attractive are their actions from the <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how to be <unk>
How much is it also worth <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is <unk> coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as well, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me about 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years later, I spent the south end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure called its beautiful views.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the experimenter to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not <unk> or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> like that, so that each of you releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below -- your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free four to five to five to five seconds, the body strikes the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is broken bones, some of which will make life organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that no, normally they fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the death of the death of <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers. There are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been before they take their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with a officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you that we were successful that day in bringing it back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train a train to the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22, last year when I got a call from a possible sign of a single suicide bomber sitting in the umbilical cord.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an officer.
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up until two times before New Jersey before New Jersey to try and sell suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
Of course, it was <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
<unk> <unk> leaned on the right, and it was gone.
This kind kind of intelligent boy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing too well, because the following day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had the order.
<unk> damage to a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it out of it.
What would you say?
What do you say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know it.
It's just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you won't fear <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about to end up their life, you've had these <unk>
They get to the person in front of it may save life and to be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> hopelessness, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> -- believe that there is nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience in there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home to talk about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I still am pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of me that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the <unk> match with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as they disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge at the late day of the day before.
Thank you very much to fight for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been before bad without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the path that her son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I replied to a radio call by a <unk> subject in the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I would see my bike. I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and it was stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the following time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to realize that day back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back to it.
"This is a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it do that he did that <unk> and gave it to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
You leave me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to do it with you.
"Dear Lord <unk> Nothing erase the 11th of 11 March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
I think I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
I was very debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General <unk> Hospital.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspired each other.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, gives me a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think you hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Typically, this is only about three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents in which I've been directly involved, just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I took my hand over three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we have to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few that have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that stop the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that each and every one of us should be striving to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you don't are, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question would ask you, how do you tell you in that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not just alone, no way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside eventually <unk> with my inner truth, with my myself.
So for reasons I get to go right later, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, you know, you know, you know, I would see it -- I would see it <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those who are around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my first agent -- ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> as I was born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines at my house, I always carried this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always wear that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that it really is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never invited me to share my story, not because it thought that I'm a bad thing, but why the world is treating those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mama, my dad and a family who will take me like I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these kinds of mysteries.
And I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me -- this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when she was still a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was <unk> she went over the <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom trunks and I won <unk> and she got a third <unk> in over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was within the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was of Queen of beauty of women, but I do can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my application for the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you go to the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was going to put two <unk> to my name.
She also happened to me when I was <unk> in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to have surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license.
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked like <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move me to New York, and it will be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who had been living on his truth, but that <unk> got to her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that I live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
I support my own network of support, to my parents, which is very strong.
And I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and some times, when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I took the phone, I would call my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not. It's just identity identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to a gender of birth, and what I try to do is put on the table -- the topic that sometimes that series was not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I am one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign for education lobbying to his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> his efforts in 2011, the National Prize for peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in industrialized societies, just from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, her birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not by his father, and not by their mother.
The neighborhood comes back to the mother and the mother and no one was attached to the father.
And a mother became a lot of a young girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just a human mother, but the daughter just <unk> when it grows, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left in home and school admits of his brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can see it.
It can play with your friends in the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he's a ban on his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of her father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if they were <unk> the code.
And it's interesting that this one of course, code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there is a rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embrace people's decisions and mother and people's decisions and the decisions of the elderly even don't like.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with a old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, I felt extremely <unk>
And so long before I <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a little girl in a school?"
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poorer countries, in democratic societies in tribal societies, is a big event for life life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and his name.
One of the school is that he has entered the world of dreams and the aspiration where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of a Hungarian way, and was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters nor his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
He encouraged me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for it, just for <unk>
I've been doing all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the same.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
The women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the director of the BBC, he was offered her same for New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October 9 of October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between the life and the death, I would love my wife to love my wife "I have <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't give you."
<unk> the fair cause.
I would give you your life for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and they <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't ask you again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and he had severe headaches and a strong headaches of head because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile with my face.
I'm going to get it right. Please don't get off!
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
And they were looking at brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when it's not just his task.
They fight with their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I am engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I met Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a brain surgery.
You're still like smart or not?
If it won't be like that, you will be intelligent again.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to do for more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations of <unk> and try to engage them for life.
More than I've been saved by a time.
But thankfully, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get to try to get the wrong dose, because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try <unk> different <unk> and I was amazed at how small changes in the wrong dose, drastically my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and normal chemicals for an twentieth man, and I was surprised to see how to think of my thinking.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person in the world, and --  -- for course a lot of times in the past I've met several types of guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had to the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to be <unk> since then I have been better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
It would be thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of reference to how I can get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like <unk>
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are the ones who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the minds works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking, and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really sophisticated mental <unk> really cool and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental imaging images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination solely to drive the world to the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups of neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, imaging from functional MRI to represent the brain, and here you can see the brain scan that was done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that individual as they were looking at that same image.
The column on the right created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left of the left -- you see that the difference is almost almost again.
This is <unk> in many different individuals, with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost almost again.
Now, let me tell you another experiment. This is from the lab by Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn our brainwaves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
So in this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were taking their brains to create a big leap of brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
So the computer, using only the brain information to the scanning <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're pretty close to that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, it creates the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems more available today, and its resolution increased by a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull, and you can introduce electrodes and introduce choices.
I can't offer that one.
Many of you are proposing new projection techniques for images even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger magnets but to this point, magnets only have a little bit of small improvement in the resolution -- no increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create more complex structures with slightly different ways -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI are to make really large magnets -- right?
However, most advances in recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and bright solutions on <unk> and <unk> in people; radio receivers in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field that is <unk> structured magnetic patterns.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns we can increase in a massive form of information that you can get in a single <unk>
And then we can then split up in layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even even neural activity directly.
We are able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have few choices more than opening up this door.
But anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet maybe to tell some person for the first time that he loves it, or tell somebody who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
So all I think is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can be able to change the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet something universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of the <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, like a <unk> <unk>
And I will be assuming that by the <unk> of my short <unk> and having my head <unk> I would ask you usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And he would have a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at her son.
But I would not say anything and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
So that conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You are a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time was prepared and it was about to go into the female issues at the table,  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep deep down and I got my eyes and my backs a four-year-old girl with a pink dress with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you <unk>
So I just took a deep deep back again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something beautiful.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I got a little bit of a girl, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink, and you sometimes like to use a terrible pajamas.
Now, I'm more than the kind of girl in a young pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. "Oh, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation ever to ever be on.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how to live in a closet.
That's like my closet not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why to come out of my closet more difficult to come out of his, but this is the <unk>  It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared in banking to rotate is harder than saying to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder than saying to your five-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard.
We need to stop looking at what we're hard to do is hard to make it difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make it feel security, or at least security than it provides the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls made their walls, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child four years that would go to coffee.
I was frozen in a corner of my profoundly dark, <unk> <unk> my grenade gay, and the move only one muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed by so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the participants knew I was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were my parents, people who knew me years old.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay history had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite historian Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who would tell us <unk>
Jack of our <unk>
And then a woman, a woman, but instead of showing desperately his support, to make me know I was on my side, finally he said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
It's like the hard conversations still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of anything to is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Sean <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
You don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something on them, not in you.
Those are the expectations about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you meet in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a sub can do it.
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to computer computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or neuroscience of Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physics theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through many different disciplines, which I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be appropriately set for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that are providing the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in a robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked a number of years: There's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of one = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a reflective force, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, they don't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain electric choices.
And so, having this equation, it's natural natural, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have a trend for more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence, a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long time of any system that you can find in it.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal tests playing games, and even making a lot of money <unk> actions, all of it without the fact that we had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a single foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave myself a goal.
He just decided for his mind to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling out of opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly moving, and it keeps the very well connected network.
This same <unk> capacity to <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it's widely applicable in defense issues, logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> negotiation in a serial series of <unk> successfully <unk> the assets under its exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term -- the work -- the work -- there was always the concept that if you would make smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, on it.
Machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take the control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that the general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, rather than being the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, "How do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of that statement to help them build artificial artificial whether to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between our stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that we will get.
The data came up by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance between them and their mother's star.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's land of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own.
At its time, this is clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've driven at a global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist in climate, or no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be a potentially livable world shown that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now offered not only short space flights but also the <unk> to live on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> we remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> ideas, compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> through our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will be able to get a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some of Mars to save out of this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like to like exploration exploration, I'm in deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is as you imagine the captain of Titanic will tell you that the party of Titanic will have place later on the life boats   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration exploration, and the preservation of the land is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of wanting to understand and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces that are in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the Enrico <unk> Fermi asked, if you realized that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough, I get to consider to be living between the stars, they lose the notion of the importance of the planets that we would develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization <unk> will save us ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments on Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all well closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning, and my passport and my bag.
They are expensive, but sure not more expensive than a half night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, so I thought that despite the circumstances, living room.
I'm a student, a profession and a little bit about how the brain is under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> the mood levels, <unk> the <unk>
And when I got to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which was going to happen for bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen to you, the probability of it is a total mess.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month after my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> on the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing with something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you're looking forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, next, tries to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some of the things that we can do in a form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the <unk>
At the house, they put a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to take track of the location of important things, where it's all right, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the <unk> trees live, and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that are <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find out your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, <unk> <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular crate <unk>
For your English glasses a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license, you get your credit credit card in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, your brain releases smaller.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> to all of medical decisions, and actually for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from which would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the better, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you may even be likely to meet people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk>
But there's a question you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to try.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it needs to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault -- it's from scientists like me.
We have not really understood the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which believes what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can help a person?
300.
This by the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or a brain attack, or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects, Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress they don't think clearly.
So you think about how to fix this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has five percent of 300 percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug that helps you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The healthcare ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the <unk> of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about the time before the questions that you can argue that we would make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the spot.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of a lot of times, you want a more short life of pain, or a long life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the <unk> of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut down a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that are going through the window during those times of stress is the rational logical thinking -- like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail sometimes.
The idea is to think about the future how those people might be able to put systems in the place that will help to minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
They went to the snow night in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up with a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the entry door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be attached to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the 1980s, and over the <unk> and over the time, mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, to follow their rules, improve behaviors and <unk> behaviors.
So how do you understand sound from?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
And they <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sounds, and I have seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example -- for example ...
"You don't know, <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of potato chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you make them make it <unk>
This is all I call it <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's about coming next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
I would try to keep it going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the subtle and subtle <unk>
In the culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign of <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I'm going to be with my thumb that's not quite natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while he went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was astounded with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a little <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art, or I could tell you it.
I chose to make me <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions and institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and a identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value, something like taking a loan for a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel like I could do it on <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new art, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note -- you can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can say of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as much as the eye signals.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor at the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> <unk> in a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as it comes to the piano, as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so while it comes the piano, English is a linear language as if you get a seat at the same time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the chord -- create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the <unk> sign on it.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I see <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put it.
This is the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> pace for <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Take a look at <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages throughout the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do you do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third -- please stop them again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest. But they bring out meanings very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and prosperous, just like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich treasure. and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you do everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination was taking me all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrific truth.
By getting older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up the others.
The entire time, I'm now adult and I teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans are <unk>
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic pieces to get them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years old, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> labor <unk> so that the kids too <unk> can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate tools they manipulate you feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collect pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By use a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children would get a lot with robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it will transform light and web cameras on accessories and put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic <unk> floating through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would do it even more.
So the great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to fix it immediately.
I was able to research my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they get stuck with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where the water is coming in.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown and so when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can go through all kinds of things that produce <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
This prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help themselves to help other children.
I was able to ask a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe address a more difficult problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half -- maybe remember, in 2011, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started a variety of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were eating several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power station.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean.
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and the majority, at the time, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here is the use of <unk>
It might look like they didn't take work seriously, but they did have done it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
Using this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system, in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition the closest to the date.
We are approaching a half miles of the nuclear power, and with the fishermen aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with very simple and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small therefore, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and converted into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal wood, chemistry, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically can be built almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become true of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
Take for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the elderly people, transforming their standard bank chairs into new self-driving cars.
The plastic and oil and <unk> are terrible <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are in the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrific truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
And so, as scientists, creators, <unk> we have to prepare for the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that they can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different <unk>
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic thing.
One is imposes on the environment, the other I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool by Michelangelo,
But the living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that required for every cell to work and to make it <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are thicker with little <unk>
You act mainly like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen, which represents my view of the <unk> world, twice the personality of every designer and architect working on between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere shows on both the two screens behind me.
My job in its simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and approaching the growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't this possible 10 or even five years?
We live at a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they connect four disciplines that offers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, on large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 meters in diameter with a convenient foundation that one day not too far to print out and graphics buildings to the nanoscale <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every single opening is unique to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> that was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> are like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator 3D printing, <unk> printed this layer and 3D <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines very soft and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not just the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair a chair to the same structural structural and also absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this surface of the surface of the <unk> surface becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother to tell me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent to the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there was no difference between trunk, and branches, branches, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees growing trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world that was done.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if the objects just made a single part?
Let's give a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> in the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced by organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we can tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>   <unk> a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> of <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, dark, <unk> and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures a system that has built a system with multiple fog <unk>
So the robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single material that was 3.5 feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make the transition with no problems of spinning mesh, and if it broadens even more <unk>
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to be placed in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
This fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological principles into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
Our own 3D channels to control the flow of these dense <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels, useful for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk> device.
If we wanted more <unk> I would get more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football camp and 10 times more than our small intestine.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the raw tissues and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology of it.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer is using organic material.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not going to get to this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
A acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the scaffold, putting those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first went on in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, attach a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk <unk>
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we will be able to take a cocoon and it still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different parts -- and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
And so often the silk worms are to death in their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we could shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that worms of silk will go into the darker and darker areas -- so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat the heat of the silk worms about structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We wanted to <unk> <unk> of silk farm to a line.
And after four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about <unk> <unk> give this whole pavilion for the integrity.
And in a little bit more than two weeks or three weeks, I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 percent additional <unk>
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other kind of empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, in the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, that demands us, for the first time, that we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they were asked for the first time of this?
Can you take your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be about <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and he was able to play the guitar on a gang band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I was struck by something else, something totally different, and I got stuck in it, and I let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions, and I would go to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me by not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have been given to me then.
They put themselves to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they <unk> they learned from culture.
What do you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to say to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done again and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It's going to be nice to be the nice exercise of what the dream.
Why?
Although this question inspires kids to dream with what might be, don't inspire to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't be able to respond with 20 different things, even though adults are willing to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The sense of life focused on our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different themes that come up with and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for this question.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> multiple and <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms that we can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the great thing to be <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like <unk> or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in a visualization of data, traveled and math and design, when I started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at the intersections.
And there are the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their feet, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning quickly.
When we were <unk> we were <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we use, so we rarely start zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> to complete time and independent <unk>
As a child pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, <unk> was financial <unk>
It had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write the compelling the trend for editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you would do to you even if at the end of the end of the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn on anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other toilet designer designer -- sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
Science magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the market needs the ones that actually <unk>
<unk> ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have a complex problem right now, and we need more creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
And the specialist can dive deep and put ideas in practice, and <unk> offers a presence of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and working with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> most of them are told to be just more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart record, then you get it through all the media.
That's where you give the best thing to do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> at intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I had a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
Her doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, he did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
I would have been living on today, we couldn't give her more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for drug cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's kind of progress on Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of the time you spend your years <unk> or helping to take care of a friend or be treated with Alzheimer's disease.
Whether in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> booms are.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the major medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less of Alzheimer's than any other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a larger cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can make it <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years, all of us, even <unk> <unk> with aging.
We think that we will become <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy adult brain, compared to the one of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental abilities -- damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots, <unk> are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules go <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
We had a wire that could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that I would do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the cords have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, physical <unk> engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've made a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick into each of them, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a good positive, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and fix.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so it grows that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We must be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we can do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have Wired <unk> and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and day and night, they are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and they help demanding a cure.
Thank you.
This article in the New York Times, New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, it does this.
The paper is about a psychological study that was designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience by testing it myself.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers will become <unk> to become 36 questions, more and more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you <unk> to another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are more and more personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me about attention, the piece that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited everything from the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I was not hoping <unk>
However, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the smooth column -- we know a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask that you are going to do even even even even though they are still asking,
And the reason I think that I think is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand of them.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on Friday at night, and already Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called the Show Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with <unk> on your own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an international news has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write about what they did every day for weeks, they were doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers were <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at this stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public emergence together.
I television interviews, and <unk> orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons in the process of <unk> a range of that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if I really want, I mean, if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, about everything, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know whether or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions that 36 questions interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce love.
And instead of that, I was looking at foster <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic is it?
But the study did work.
Participants have felt closer to do several studies, later studies, they were also used by the <unk> protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust and interaction among strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people to <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like it was <unk>
And I said, you want to say that you would tell you from the person who you would do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did have gotten better to be able to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it's about love.
I found myself with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since he had 20, what I was supposed to virtually my entire adult life, and he was my first true love of love -- and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I went to science.
And it was all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow be the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just looked for the book that I was writing -- but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with my knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to myself then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand for me.
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not only to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> on the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people wonder when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a short cut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let me ask you questions more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love with things like this, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a known year, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still going to keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, I had not considered everything that we were supposed to do.
I didn't think that I would have both of the ones that make that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded about 36 questions, we chosen to love somebody so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what you would do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the final happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really written.
But what I have in change is the chance to choose someone, and the hope that he also will love, and it's a scary thing to me, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in full mountain and in a way, I came like a forest <unk>
The city of New York did a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar note, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and do <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I did a kind of a <unk> <unk> at Agnes Martin, it was covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, and thinking I could be able to get it.
Instead, it happened to the opposite: somehow it seemed like it rise of size, as if it was that they <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did I put more boxes.
So this time, I started adding some electronic elements this time, these strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to come up and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> and draw just like a <unk> body in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of humans inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin, was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the layers of glass, similar to drawing on a window, then in another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's been <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, he's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animals are traveling between two worlds.
They're the world of representation -- this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with heads of animals are driven by <unk> ready to suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a God strapped into a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of <unk> <unk> the shelter of bin Laden's Laden's all kinds of weird things you can find if they look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, it's also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand can be clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> to keep the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That is the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a tail of snake that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, its tail on fire in the <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> was made of terrorists cards.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material or material or magazine.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're just like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taking years.
Each one is basically a scanning electron microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of <unk> in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it takes the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and you're communicating with the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside of <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a writer, a <unk> <unk> a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
You know, the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first of the stomach, your bowels and other organs.
And I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is going to make it in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are willing to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the death penalty account.
But they're also known for their side effects <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it takes you to get to the <unk> you get worse and worse even for the time that it takes to get to your fate, which is where it's more important, in the HIV tank, of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph percent, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood bloodstream of the patients that are attached to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big issue of HIV treatment with today's drugs that is a treatment of career running through oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Let me make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> to care about wounds and diabetes facial diabetes, you can be used for anything else, including the drug <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill up extremely small, which is open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "What is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam of the cell membrane on the cell membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro plates, or in <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the website.
The second head, which is a camera is driving to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributed the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a treatment with laser treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've studied armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these market agents and study ways to encourage the transition from violent involvement to nonviolent confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding groups is key to solving almost all of the conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> deals of peace between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we should even be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflicts resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons why they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent heritage against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social services network and a military system.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
They're multitasking out.
It would be a complex machinery of communication stations by radio, TV channels television channels and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the printed magazine magazine in English and published for <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex <unk> money <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
build schools, they build schools, run in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state would not make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a <unk> Afghanistan was torn up by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can be understood also <unk> the efforts of these groups for us.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated deal of the population.
But in general, providing social services, means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 -- Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, they participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated things are these organizations, we can least, we can be something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all its <unk> they collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of the nation that we live and hybrids, and the weak things are states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
It takes that gap of government to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to set up and transforming peace.
If we can better understand groups of <unk> we'll understand better what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need to get long-term investments to fill that safety, to fill that <unk> of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a potter, but it's pretty bad.
And so I became a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what it started as a personal joke was destined to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> of sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in <unk> that could be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it is equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that she is actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I got older, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of it.
For me, certain statements are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as a free or violence.
We have right to use it in an easy way and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender and religion and our social condition, and a lot more.
We need to have these differences in account and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession:
When I drive to work, I hear music -- I hear a little bit volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and my offends a deep <unk> the classic <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually find your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical heroes.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all of the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass and the nest <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
They went from fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and I can see the <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my offenses are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it gets economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the working workers, gay women, <unk> and <unk> women <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist
It also happens as well, as a fan, I feel a lot of pressure.
Do we have this tendency to put of psychologists <unk> in a <unk>
And we hope that we will actually get it to the best.
When we were <unk> they were very happy from the same <unk> where they <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put myself in there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders and leaders are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what that was that <unk> for fear of not being able to meet the <unk>
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of <unk>
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star from the pop star openly feminism and make the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics have endless discussions if we were <unk> it was or not exactly the feminist thing.
It would take her question instead of simply believing the word of an adult adult woman, <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism for any woman, <unk> until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question is, or more importantly, one more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to make a <unk> supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until the shift actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions would be justify that it makes it more difficult for women to make equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And because of the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of the sudden, the best option will be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sports, and <unk> <unk>
We can change radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk>
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish your magazine, participate in their project, or work with you, until they didn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, and we can also inspire themselves to be even more like us, to overcome the barriers to the decision choices.
Because we are not <unk> but not these efforts without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can commit these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, to the people in the power of directors and producers of music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also be able to be able to say to our best, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I got my voice, and after everything I was not afraid to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and part of it, I also discovered that if I was a little bit brave another woman might hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other hand, I maintain the relational reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking -- what I say and what I do, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need to be a bit of a <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California, had been <unk> for me to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> which may be lousy for a child with a immune system -- is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine for over the last century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified to be an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the most intelligent scientists that the theory cause vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in the time.
Over the most part of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she will create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence kept stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> researchers like <unk> <unk> were routinely referred to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of <unk> diagnosis, and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of their son of two years, visual contact of view.
If the diagnostic criteria they had to be <unk> why were they so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow progress and focus on the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a psychiatrist. I read a <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital, in <unk> <unk> he published an article which describes 11 young patients who looked at the people around their own, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving their faces, but they were prey of panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the age of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject said that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as far as it was <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give birth to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine from 10 children sent by other doctors to her office to be <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child disorders caused by cold, cold, <unk>
These kids, he said, have been very carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, nevertheless, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster together in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records on his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John <unk> warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie, without special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend in the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
It took a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find children autistic in the community.
What they saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse of autism.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, or in the <unk> of <unk>
In the way, these kids didn't fit <unk> and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did no one had noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found an reference to an article published in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he got <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> on his own work.
There was no translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for childhood teaching children were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic, they started with music exercises with music, and the kids were still their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents about causing autism, Asperger's described as a disabled disability that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that ranged an amazing range of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> in the pop culture like the awkward social and Professor <unk>
He was more than even though that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early changes in the 1990s, their changes in <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide <unk>
These changes were no broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before he went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition of <unk> <unk> and parents of the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical trials to be able to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> effect of the perfect <unk>
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just as they predicted <unk> and <unk> actually hoped that that was out there, so that the people with autism and their families will finally get the support and the services that <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for increasing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> credible history, as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the death center that one of every 68 child in America are in the spectrum, is right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs -- the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit for detail.
Without doubt, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on deck of <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
